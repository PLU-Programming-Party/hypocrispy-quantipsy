Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge.

"Over the years, I have come to realize that the greatest trap in our life is not success, popularity, or power, but self-rejection. Success, popularity, and power can indeed present a great temptation, but their seductive quality often comes from the way they are part of the much larger temptation to self-rejection. When we have come to believe in the voices that call us worthless and unlovable, then success, popularity, and power are easily perceived as attractive solutions. The real trap, however, is self-rejection. As soon as someone accuses me or criticizes me, as soon as I am rejected, left alone, or abandoned, I find myself thinking, ""Well, that proves once again that I am a nobody."" ... [My dark side says,] I am no good... I deserve to be pushed aside, forgotten, rejected, and abandoned.

"America is a leap of the imagination. From its beginning, people had only a persistent idea of what a good country should be. The idea involved freedom, equality, justice, and the pursuit of happiness; nowadays most of us probably could not describe it a lot more clearly than that. The truth is, it always has been a bit of a guess. No one has ever known for sure whether a country based on such an idea is really possible, but again and again, we have leaped toward the idea and hoped. What SuAnne Big Crow demonstrated in the Lead high school gym is that making the leap is the whole point. The idea does not truly live unless it is expressed by an act; the country does not live unless we make the leap from our tribe or focus group or gated community or demographic, and land on the shaky platform of that idea of a good country which all kinds of different people share.",Ian Frazier,risk,Goodreads – risk,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

One should visit such places often, and be conscious, in the midst of the city, of their surrounding presence.

"Those who love their dream of a Christian community more than they love the Christian community itself become destroyers of that Christian community even though their personal intentions may be ever so honest, earnest and sacrificial. God hates this wishful dreaming because it makes the dreamer proud and pretentious. Those who dream of this idolized community demand that it be fulfilled by God, by others and by themselves. They enter the community of Christians with their demands set up by their own law, and judge one another and God accordingly. It is not we who build. Christ builds the church. Whoever is mindful to build the church is surely well on the way to destroying it, for he will build a temple to idols without wishing or knowing it. We must confess he builds. We must proclaim, he builds. We must pray to him, and he will build. We do not know his plan. We cannot see whether he is building or pulling down. It may be that the times which by human standards are the times of collapse are for him the great times of construction. It may be that the times which from a human point are great times for the church are times when it's pulled down. It is a great comfort which Jesus gives to his church. You confess, preach, bear witness to me, and I alone will build where it pleases me. Do not meddle in what is not your providence.

"Computers are actually pretty simple.  We’re sitting here on a bench in this cafe. Let’s assume that you understood only the most rudimentary of directions and you asked how to find the rest room. I would have to describe it to you in very specific and precise instructions. I might say, ""Scoot sideways two meters off the bench. Stand erect. Lift left foot. Bend left knee until it is horizontal. Extend left foot and shift weight 300 centimeters forward …"" and on and on. If you could interpret all those instructions 100 times faster than any other person in this cafe, you would appear to be a magician: You could run over and grab a milk shake and bring it back and set it on the table and snap your fingers, and I’d think you made the milk shake appear, because it was so fast relative to my perception. That’s exactly what a computer does. It takes these very, very simple-minded instructions — ""Go fetch a number, add it to this number, put the result there, perceive if it’s greater than this other number""—but executes them at a rate of, let’s say, 1,000,000 per second. At 1,000,000 per second, the results appear to be magic. … Most people have no concept of how an automatic transmission works, yet they know how to drive a car.

"The hard part of what we're up against now is that people ask you about specifics and you can't tell them. A hundred years ago, if somebody had asked  Alexander Graham Bell , ""What are you going to be able to do with a telephone?"" he wouldn't have been able to tell him the ways the telephone would affect the world. He didn't know that people would use the telephone to call up and find out what movies were playing that night or to order some groceries or call a relative on the other side of the globe. But remember that first the public telegraph was inaugurated, in 1844. It was an amazing breakthrough in communications. You could actually send messages from New York to San Francisco in an afternoon. People talked about putting a telegraph on every desk in America to improve productivity. But it wouldn't have worked. It required that people learn this whole sequence of strange incantations, Morse code, dots and dashes, to use the telegraph. It took about 40 hours to learn. The majority of people would never learn how to use it. So, fortunately, in the 1870s, Bell filed the patents for the telephone. It performed basically the same function as the telegraph, but people already knew how to use it. Also, the neatest thing about it was that besides allowing you to communicate with just words, it allowed you to sing. … It allowed you to intone your words with meaning beyond the simple linguistics. And we're in the same situation today. Some people are saying that we ought to put an IBM PC on every desk in America to improve productivity. It won't work. The special incantations you have to learn this time are ""slash q-zs"" and things like that. The manual for WordStar, the most popular word-processing program, is 400 pages thick. To write a novel, you have to read a novel—one that reads like a mystery to most people. They're not going to learn slash q-z any more than they're going to learn Morse code. That is what Macintosh is all about. It's the first ""telephone"" of our industry. And, besides that, the neatest thing about it, to me, is that the Macintosh lets you sing the way the telephone did. You don't simply communicate words, you have special print styles and the ability to draw and add pictures to express yourself.",Steve Jobs,failure,Wikiquote – Steve Jobs,Entrepreneur,North America,2000s,male

"When I was young, there was an amazing publication called  The Whole Earth Catalog , which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand  not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960's, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and Polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.  Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue.  It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words:  ""Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish."" It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself.

The variant mentioned above may possibly be derived from a reduction of a statement known to have been made by  Isaac Newton , who at the head of notes he titled  Quaestiones Quaedam Philosophicae  ( Certain Philosophical Questions ) wrote in Latin:  ""Amicus Plato— amicus Aristoteles— magis amica veritas""  which translates to: "" Plato is my friend— Aristotle is my friend— but my greatest friend is truth.

"Another possible origin of the ""dear is Plato"" statement is in the  Nicomachean Ethics ; the Ross translation (of 1096a.11–1096a.16) provides:  ""We had perhaps better consider the universal good and discuss thoroughly what is meant by it, although such an inquiry is made an uphill one by the fact that the Forms have been introduced by friends of our own. Yet it would perhaps be thought to be better, indeed to be our duty, for the sake of maintaining the truth even to destroy what touches us closely, especially as we are philosophers; for,  while both are dear, piety requires us to honour truth above our friends .""   Note that the last clause, when quoted by itself loses the connection to ""the friends"" who introduced ""the Forms"", Plato above all.

It comprises rice, barley, wheat, kidney beans, beans, lentils, etc., clarified butter, oil, honey, molasses, treacle, sugar cane, coarse sugar, etc.; food prepared with these is proper food.

"The Buddha of the present time is the  Lord Gautama , who took his last birth in India about two thousand five hundred years ago... Seven Buddhas appear in succession during a world-period, one for each race, and each in turn takes charge of the special work of the Second Ray for the whole world, devoting himself to that part of it which lies in the higher worlds, while he entrusts to his assistant and representative,   the Bodhisattva (Maitreya) , the office of World-Teacher  for the lower planes. For One who attains this position Oriental writers think no praise too high, no devotion too deep, and just as we regard those Masters to whom we look up as all but divine in goodness and wisdom, so to an even greater degree do they regard the Buddha.   p. 281",Buddha,leadership,Wikiquote – Buddha,Religious Leader,Asia,-500s,male
"Now at this time in the remote past to which we have referred, humanity should have begun to provide its own Teachers; but we are told that no one had quite reached the level required for the incurring of so tremendous a responsibility. The first-fruits of Humanity at this period were two Brothers who stood equal in occult development; one being he whom we now call the Lord Gautama Buddha, and the other our present World-Teacher,  the Lord Maitreya .... Out of his great love for humanity the Lord Gautama instantly offered to make himself ready to undertake whatever additional effort might be necessary to attain the required development. We learn from tradition that life after life he practised special virtues, each life showing out some great quality achieved.  p. 282",Buddha,leadership,Wikiquote – Buddha,Religious Leader,Asia,-500s,male
"That great sacrifice of the Buddha is spoken of in all the sacred books of the Buddhists; but they have not understood the nature of the sacrifice, for many believe it to have been the descent of the Lord Buddha from Nirvanic levels after his Illumination to teach his Law. It is true that he did so descend, but that would not be anything in the nature of a sacrifice; it would only be an ordinary, but not very pleasant piece of work. The great sacrifice that he made was this spending of thousands of years in order to qualify himself to be the first of mankind who should help his brother-men by teaching to them the Wisdom which is life eternal. That work was done, and nobly done. We know something of the various incarnations that he took after that, as Bodhisattva of his time,  though there may be many more of which we know nothing.   p. 283",Buddha,success,Wikiquote – Buddha,Religious Leader,Asia,-500s,male
"The Lord Buddha has his own special type of force, which he outpours when he gives his blessing to the world, and this benediction is a unique and very marvellous thing; for by his authority and position a Buddha has access to planes of nature which are altogether beyond our reach, hence he can transmute and draw down to our level the forces peculiar to those planes. Without this mediation of the Buddha these forces would be of no use to us here in physical life; their vibrations are so tremendous, so incredibly rapid, that they would pass through us unsensed at any level we can reach, and we should never even know of their existence. But as it is, the force of the blessing is scattered all over the world; and it instantly finds for itself channels through which it can pour (just as water instantly finds an open pipe), thereby strengthening all good work and bringing peace to the hearts of those who are able to receive it. p. 284",Buddha,leadership,Wikiquote – Buddha,Religious Leader,Asia,-500s,male
"The Wesak Festival. The occasion selected for this wonderful outpouring is the full moon day of the Indian month of Vaisakh (called in Ceylon Wesak, and usually corresponding to the English May), the anniversary of all the momentous occurrences of  His  last earthly life, His birth, His attainment of Buddhahood, and His departure from the physical body. In connection with this visit of His... an exoteric ceremony is performed on the physical plane... Whether He shows himself to pilgrims I am not certain; they all prostrate themselves at the moment when He appears, but that may be only in imitation of the prostration of the Adepts and their pupils, who do see the  Lord Gautama . It seems probable that some at least of the pilgrims have seen Him for themselves, for the existence of the ceremony is widely known among the Buddhists of central Asia, and it is spoken of as the appearance of the Shadow or Reflection of the Buddha, the description given of it in such traditional accounts being as a rule fairly accurate. So far as we can see there appears to be no reason why any person whatever who happens to be in the neighborhood at the time may not be present at the ceremony; no apparent effort is made to restrict the number of spectators; though it is true that one hears stories of parties of pilgrims who have wandered for years without being able to find the spot.

"The  Lord Maitreya , whose name means kindliness or compassion, took up the office of Bodhisattva when the Lord Gautama laid it down, and since then He has made many efforts for the promotion of Religion. One of His first steps on assuming office was to take advantage of the tremendous magnetism generated in the world by the presence of the Buddha, to arrange that great Teachers should simultaneously appear in many different parts of the earth; so that within a comparatively short space of time we find not only the Buddha Himself, Shri Shankaracharya and Mahavira in India, but also Mithra in Persia, Laotse and Confucius in China, and Pythagoras in ancient Greece.  p.297",Buddha,leadership,Wikiquote – Buddha,Religious Leader,Asia,-500s,male

Therefore the Teaching of Gotama should be accepted as the first teaching of the laws of matter and the evolution of the world.

"One should not think that the life of Gotama Buddha was spent in universal acknowledgment and quiet. On the contrary, there are indications of slander and all kinds of obstacles, through which the Teacher, as a true fighter, only strengthened himself, thus augmenting the significance of his achievement. Many incidents speak about the hostility which he encountered from ascetics and Brahmins, who hated him. The former for his reproval of their fanaticism, the latter for his refusal to admit their rights to social privileges and to the knowledge of truth by right of birth.   To the first, he said: “If only through the renunciation of food and human conditions one could attain perfection and liberation from the bonds which tie man to Earth, then a horse or a cow would have reached it long ago.”   To the second: “According to his deeds a man becomes a pariah; according to his deeds he becomes a Brahmin. The fire kindled by a Brahmin, and the fire kindled by a Shudra have an equal flame, brightness, and light. To what has your isolation brought you? In order to procure  bread  you go to the general market, and you value the coins from the purse of a Shudra. Your isolation may be termed merely plunder.

"No teaching foresaw the future with such precision as Buddhism. Parallel with reverence to the Buddha, Buddhism develops the veneration of  Bodhisattvas —future Buddhas. According to the tradition,  Gotama , before reaching the state of Buddha, had been a Bodhisattva for many centuries. The word, Bodhisattva, comprises two concepts: Bodhi—enlightenment or awakening, and Sattva—the essence. Who are these Boddhisattvas? The disciples of Buddhas, who voluntarily have renounced their personal liberation and, following the example of their Teacher, have entered upon a long, weary thorny path of help to humanity. Such Bodhisattvas appear on earth in the midst of the most varying conditions of life. Physically indistinguishable in any way from the rest of humanity, they differ completely in their psychology, constantly being the heralds of the principle of the common welfare.",Buddha,leadership,Wikiquote – Buddha,Religious Leader,Asia,-500s,male
"According to tradition, the Blessed One preordained the  Bodhisattva Maitreya  as his successor. “And the Blessed One said to Ananda, ‘I am not the first Buddha who has come upon Earth, nor shall I be the last.

He will reveal to you the same eternal truths, that I have taught you. He will establish his Law, glorious in its origin, glorious at the climax, and glorious at the goal, in the spirit and in the letter. He will proclaim a righteous life, wholly perfect and pure, such as I now proclaim. His disciples will number many thousands while mine number many hundreds.’ “Ananda said, ‘How shall we know him?’  “The Blessed One said, ‘He will be known as Maitreya!’ ""   ( Paul Carus ,  The Gospel of Buddha )   The future Buddha,  Maitreya,  as his name indicates, is the Buddha of compassion and love.

"It is interesting to note that reverence of many Bodhisattvas was accepted and developed only in the Mahayana school. Nevertheless, the reverence of one Bodhisattva, Maitreya, as a successor chosen by Buddha himself, is accepted also in the Hinayana. Thus, one Bodhisattva, Maitreya, embraces the complete scope, being the personification of all aspirations of Buddhism. What qualities must a Bodhisattva possess? In the Teaching of Gotama Buddha and in the Teaching of Bodhisattva Maitreya, given by him to Asanga according to tradition in the fourth century (Mahayana-Sutralankara), the maximum development of energy, courage, patience, constancy of striving, and fearlessness was underlined first of all.

"To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree. When it was first said that the sun stood still and the world turned round, the common sense of mankind declared the doctrine false; but the old saying of  Vox populi, vox Dei , as every  philosopher  knows, cannot be trusted in  science . Reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a simple and imperfect eye to one complex and perfect can be shown to exist, each grade being useful to its possessor, as is certainly the case; if further, the eye ever varies and the variations be inherited, as is likewise certainly the case; and if such variations should be useful to any animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex  eye  could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our  imagination , should not be considered as subversive of the theory. How a nerve comes to be sensitive to  light , hardly concerns us more than how life itself originated; but I may remark that, as some of the lowest  organisms , in which nerves cannot be detected, are capable of perceiving light, it does not seem impossible that certain sensitive elements in their sarcode should become aggregated and developed into nerves, endowed with this special sensibilites.",Charles Darwin,success,Wikiquote – Charles Darwin,Naturalist,Europe,1850s,male

"In the temple of science are many mansions, and various indeed are they that dwell therein and the motives that have led them thither.  Many take to science out of a joyful sense of superior intellectual power; science is their own special sport to which they look for vivid experience and the satisfaction of ambition; many others are to be found in the temple who have offered the products of their brains on this altar for purely utilitarian purposes.  Were an angel of the Lord to come and drive all the people belonging to these two categories out of the temple, the assemblage would be seriously depleted, but there would still be some men, of both present and past times, left inside. Our  Planck  is one of them, and that is why we love him.  I am quite aware that we have just now lightheartedly expelled in imagination many excellent men who are largely, perhaps chiefly, responsible for the buildings of the temple of science; and in many cases, our angel would find it a pretty ticklish job to decide. But of one thing I feel sure: if the types we have just expelled were the only types there were, the temple would never have come to be, any more than a forest can grow which consists of nothing but creepers. For these people any sphere of human activity will do if it comes to a point; whether they become engineers, officers, tradesmen, or scientists depends on circumstances. Now let us have another look at those who have found favor with the angel.  Most of them are somewhat odd, uncommunicative, solitary fellows, really less like each other, in spite of these common characteristics, than the hosts of the rejected. What has brought them to the temple? That is a difficult question and no single answer will cover it.",Albert Einstein,motivation,Wikiquote – Albert Einstein,Physicist,Europe,1920s,male

"Variant translation: One of the strongest motives that lead men to art and science is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness, from the fetters of one's own ever-shifting desires. A finely tempered nature longs to escape from the personal life into the world of objective perception and thought. With this negative motive goes a positive one.  Man seeks to form for himself, in whatever manner is suitable for him, a simplified and lucid image of the world, and so to overcome the world of experience by striving to replace it to some extent by this image. This is what the painter does, and the poet, the speculative philosopher, the natural scientist, each in his own way. Into this image and its formation, he places the center of gravity of his emotional life, in order to attain the peace and serenity that he cannot find within the narrow confines of swirling personal experience.",Albert Einstein,motivation,Wikiquote – Albert Einstein,Physicist,Europe,1920s,male

Does the product of such a modest effort deserve to be called by the proud name of a theory of the universe? In my belief the name is justified;  for the general laws on which the structure of theoretical physics is based claim to be valid for any natural phenomenon whatsoever. With them, it ought to be possible to arrive at the description, that is to say, the theory, of every natural process, including life, by means of pure deduction, if that process of deduction were not far beyond the capacity of the human intellect.

The development from a religion of fear to moral religion is a great step in peoples' lives. And yet, that primitive religions are based entirely on fear and the religions of civilized peoples purely on morality is a prejudice against which we must be on our guard.

"Wording in  Ideas and Opinions : Common to all these types is the anthropomorphic character of their conception of God. In general, only individuals of exceptional endowments, and exceptionally high-minded communities, rise to any considerable extent above this level. But there is a third stage of religious experience which belongs to all of them, even though it is rarely found in a pure form: I shall call it cosmic religious feeling.  It is very difficult to elucidate this feeling to anyone who is entirely without it, especially as there is no anthropomorphic conception of God corresponding to it. The individual feels the futility of human desires and aims and the sublimity and marvelous order which reveal themselves both in nature and in the world of thought.  Individual existence impresses him as a sort of prison and he wants to experience the universe as a single significant whole. The beginnings of cosmic religious feeling already appear at an early stage of development, e.g., in many of the Psalms of David and in some of the Prophets. Buddhism, as we have learned especially from the wonderful writings of Schopenhauer, contains a much stronger element of this.  The religious geniuses of all ages have been distinguished by this kind of religious feeling, which knows no dogma and no God conceived in man's image; so that there can be no church whose central teachings are based on it. Hence it is precisely among the heretics of every age that we find men who were filled with this highest kind of religious feeling and were in many cases regarded by their contemporaries as atheists, sometimes also as saints.

A God who rewards and punishes is inconceivable to him for the simple reason that a man's actions are determined by necessity, external and internal, so that in God's eyes he cannot be responsible, any more than an inanimate object is responsible for the motions it undergoes.  Science has therefore been charged with undermining morality, but the charge is unjust. A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hopes of reward after death.",Albert Einstein,risk,Wikiquote – Albert Einstein,Physicist,Europe,1920s,male
"Wording in  Ideas and Opinions : It is therefore easy to see why the churches have always fought science and persecuted its devotees. On the other hand,  I maintain that the cosmic religious feeling is the strongest and noblest motive for scientific research.  Only those who realize the immense efforts and, above all, the devotion without which pioneer work in theoretical science cannot be achieved are able to grasp the strength of the emotion out of which alone such work, remote as it is from the immediate realities of life, can issue. What a  deep conviction of the rationality of the universe  and what a yearning to understand, were it but a feeble reflection of the mind revealed in this world, Kepler and Newton must have had to enable them to spend years of solitary labor in disentangling the principles of celestial mechanics!  Those whose acquaintance with scientific research is derived chiefly from its practical results easily develop a completely false notion of the mentality of the men who, surrounded by a skeptical world, have shown the way to kindred spirits scattered wide through the world and through the centuries.  Only one who has devoted his life to similar ends can have a vivid realization of what has inspired these men and given them the strength to remain true to their purpose in spite of countless failures. It is cosmic religious feeling that gives a man such strength. A contemporary has said, not unjustly, that in this materialistic age of ours the serious scientific workers are the only profoundly religious people.",Albert Einstein,motivation,Wikiquote – Albert Einstein,Physicist,Europe,1920s,male

"A person who is religiously enlightened appears to me to be one who has, to the best of his ability, liberated himself from the fetters of his selfish desires and is preoccupied with thoughts, feelings, and aspirations to which he clings because of their superpersonal value.  It seems to me that what is important is the force of this superpersonal content and the depth of the conviction concerning its overpowering meaningfulness, regardless of whether any attempt is made to unite this content with a divine Being, for otherwise it would not be possible to count  Buddha  and  Spinoza  as religious personalities.  Accordingly, a religious person is devout in the sense that he has no doubt of the significance and loftiness of those superpersonal objects and goals which neither require nor are capable of rational foundation. They exist with the same necessity and matter-of-factness as he himself.  In this sense religion is the age-old endeavor of mankind to become clearly and completely conscious of these values and goals and constantly to strengthen and extend their effect. If one conceives of religion and science according to these definitions then a conflict between them appears impossible.

"A conflict arises when a religious community insists on the absolute truthfulness of all statements recorded in the Bible. This means an intervention on the part of religion into the sphere of science; this is where the struggle of the Church against the doctrines of Galileo and Darwin belongs. On the other hand, representatives of science have often made an attempt to arrive at fundamental judgments with respect to values and ends on the basis of scientific method, and in this way have set themselves in opposition to religion. These conflicts have all sprung from fatal errors.",Albert Einstein,leadership,Wikiquote – Albert Einstein,Physicist,Europe,1920s,male
"Even though the realms of religion and science in themselves are clearly marked off from each other, nevertheless there exist between the two strong reciprocal relationships and dependencies.  Though religion may be that which determines the goal, it has, nevertheless, learned from science, in the broadest sense, what means will contribute to the attainment of the goals it has set up. But  science can only be created by those who are thoroughly imbued with the aspiration toward truth and understanding. This source of feeling, however, springs from the sphere of religion. To this there also belongs the faith in the possibility that the regulations valid for the world of existence are rational, that is, comprehensible to reason. I cannot conceive of a genuine scientist without that profound faith.  The situation may be expressed by an image:  science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.  Though I have asserted above that in truth a legitimate conflict between religion and science cannot exist, I must nevertheless qualify this assertion once again on an essential point, with reference to the actual content of historical religions. This qualification has to do with the concept of God. During the youthful period of mankind's spiritual evolution human fantasy created gods in man's own image, who, by the operations of their will were supposed to determine, or at any rate to influence, the phenomenal world. Man sought to alter the disposition of these gods in his own favor by means of magic and prayer. The idea of God in the religions taught at present is a sublimation of that old concept of the gods. Its anthropomorphic character is shown, for instance, by the fact that men appeal to the Divine Being in prayers and plead for the fulfillment of their wishes.",Albert Einstein,failure,Wikiquote – Albert Einstein,Physicist,Europe,1920s,male
"Nobody, certainly, will deny that the idea of the existence of an omnipotent, just, and omnibeneficent personal God is able to accord man solace, help, and guidance; also, by virtue of its simplicity it is accessible to the most undeveloped mind. But, on the other hand, there are decisive weaknesses attached to this idea in itself, which have been painfully felt since the beginning of history.  That is, if this being is omnipotent, then every occurrence, including every human action, every human thought, and every human feeling and aspiration is also His work; how is it possible to think of holding men responsible for their deeds and thoughts before such an almighty Being? In giving out punishment and rewards He would to a certain extent be passing judgment on Himself. How can this be combined with the goodness and righteousness ascribed to Him?   The main source of the present-day conflicts between the spheres of religion and of science lies in this concept of a personal God.",Albert Einstein,risk,Wikiquote – Albert Einstein,Physicist,Europe,1920s,male
"When the number of factors coming into play in a phenomenological complex is too large, scientific method in most cases fails us. One need only think of the weather, in which case prediction even for a few days ahead is impossible.

"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature. For him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an independent cause of natural events. To be sure, the doctrine of a personal God interfering with natural events could never be refuted, in the real sense, by science, for this doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.  But I am persuaded that such behavior on the part of the representatives of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal. For a doctrine which is able to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark, will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm to human progress. In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests. In their labors they will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity itself.

"If it is one of the goals of religion to liberate mankind as far as possible from the bondage of egocentric cravings, desires, and fears, scientific reasoning can aid religion in yet another sense. Although it is true that it is the goal of science to discover rules which permit the association and foretelling of facts, this is not its only aim. It also seeks to reduce the connections discovered to the smallest possible number of mutually independent conceptual elements. It is in this striving after the rational unification of the manifold that it encounters its greatest successes, even though it is precisely this attempt which causes it to run the greatest risk of falling a prey to illusions.  But whoever has undergone the intense experience of successful advances made in this domain is moved by profound reverence for the rationality made manifest in existence.  By way of the understanding he achieves a far-reaching emancipation from the shackles of personal hopes and desires, and thereby attains that humble attitude of mind toward the grandeur of reason incarnate in existence, and which, in its profoundest depths, is inaccessible to man. This attitude, however, appears to me to be religious, in the highest sense of the word. And so it seems to me that  science not only purifies the religious impulse of the dross of its anthropomorphism but also contributes to a religious spiritualization of our understanding of life. The further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances, the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life, and the fear of death, and blind faith, but through striving after rational knowledge.",Albert Einstein,success,Wikiquote – Albert Einstein,Physicist,Europe,1920s,male

The answers to these questions have, for centuries, given rise to considerable dispute and, indeed, bitter fighting.

"Science, in the immediate, produces knowledge and, indirectly, means of action. It leads to methodical action if definite goals are set up in advance.

While it is true that science, to the extent of its grasp of causative connections, may reach important conclusions as to the compatibility and incompatibility of goals and evaluations, the independent and fundamental definitions regarding goals and values remain beyond science's reach. As regards religion, on the other hand, one is generally agreed that it deals with goals and evaluations and, in general, with the emotional foundation of human thinking and acting, as far as these are not predetermined by the inalterable hereditary disposition of the human species.  Religion is concerned with man's attitude toward nature at large, with the establishing of ideals for the individual and communal life, and with mutual human relationship.  These ideals religion attempts to attain by exerting an educational influence on tradition and through the development and promulgation of certain easily accessible thoughts and narratives (epics and myths) which are apt to influence evaluation and action along the lines of the accepted ideals.",Albert Einstein,success,Wikiquote – Albert Einstein,Physicist,Europe,1920s,male

There are pessimists who hold that such a state of affairs is necessarily inherent in human nature; it is those who propound such views that are the enemies of true religion, for they imply thereby that religious teachings are Utopian ideals and unsuited to afford guidance in human affairs.

Moreover, I soon discovered the cruelty of that chase, which in those years was much more carefully covered up by hypocrisy and glittering words than is the case today. By the mere existence of his stomach everyone was condemned to participate in that chase. Moreover, it was possible to satisfy the stomach by such participation, but not man in so far as he is a thinking and feeling being. As the first way out there was religion, which is implanted into every child by way of the traditional education-machine.  Thus I came—despite the fact that I was the son of entirely irreligious (Jewish) parents—to a deep religiosity, which, however, found an abrupt ending at the age of 12.  Through the reading of popular scientific books I soon reached the conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not be true. The consequence was a positively fanatic [orgy of] freethinking coupled with the impression that youth is intentionally being deceived by the state through lies; it was a crushing impression.  Suspicion against every kind of authority grew out of this experience, a skeptical attitude towards the convictions which were alive in any specific social environment—an attitude which has never again left me , even though later on, because of a better insight into the causal connections, it lost some of its original poignancy.",Albert Einstein,leadership,Wikiquote – Albert Einstein,Physicist,Europe,1920s,male

The contemplation of this world beckoned like a liberation, and I soon noticed that many a man whom I had learned to esteem and to admire had found inner freedom and security in devoted occupation with it. The mental grasp of this extrapersonal world within the frame of the given possibilites swam as highest aim half consciously and half unconsciously before my mind's eye. Similarly motivated men of the present and of the past, as well as the insights which they had achieved, were the friends which could not be lost.

For how, otherwise, should it happen that sometimes we ""wonder"" quite spontaneously about some experience? This ""wondering"" seems to occur when an experience comes into conflict with a world of concepts which is already sufficiently fixed in us.

I can still remember—or at least believe I can remember—that this experience made a deep and lasting impression upon me. Something deeply hidden had to be behind things. What man sees before him from infancy causes no reaction of this kind; he is not surprised over the falling of bodies, concerning wind and rain, nor concerning the moon or about the fact that the moon does not fall down, nor concerning the differences between living and non-living matter. At the age of 12 I experienced a second wonder of a totally different nature: in a little book dealing with Euclidean plane geometry, which came into my hands at the beginning of a schoolyear. Here were assertions, as for example the intersection of the three altitudes of a triangle in one point, which—though by no means evident—could nevertheless be proved with such certainty that any doubt appeared to be out of the question.

By and by I despaired of the possibility of discovering the true laws by means of constructive efforts based on known facts. The longer and the more despairingly I tried, the more I came to the conviction that only the discovery of a universal formal principle could lead us to assured results. . . . How, then, could such a universal principle be found?  After ten years of reflection such a principle resulted from a paradox upon which I had already hit at the age of sixteen: If I pursue a beam of light with the velocity  c  (velocity of light in a vacuum), I should observe such a beam as a spatially oscillatory electromagnetic field at rest. However, there seems to be no such thing, whether on the bases of experience or according to Maxwell's equations.

I even admit that a complete theoretical description is, in principle, thinkable. But I consider it proven that the search for such a complete description would be aimless. For the lawfulness of nature is thus constituted that the laws can be completely and suitably formulated within the framework of our incomplete description.   To this I can only reply as follows: Your point of view — taken as theoretical possibility — is incontestable. For me, however, the expectation that the adequate formulation of the universal laws involves the use of  all  conceptual elements which are necessary for a complete description, is more natural. It is furthermore not at all surprising that, by using an incomplete description, (in the main) only statistical statements can be obtained out of such description.

The use of fire, the cultivation of edible plants, the steam engine — each was discovered by one man.

"The economic anarchy of capitalist society as it exists today is, in my opinion, the real source of the evil.  We see before us a huge community of producers the members of which are unceasingly striving to deprive each other of the fruits of their collective labor — not by force, but on the whole in faithful compliance with legally established rules.",Albert Einstein,failure,Wikiquote – Albert Einstein,Physicist,Europe,1920s,male
"Production is carried on for profit, not for use.  There is no provision that all those able and willing to work will always be in a position to find employment; an ""army of unemployed"" almost always exists. The worker is constantly in fear of losing his job. Since unemployed and poorly paid workers do not provide a profitable market, the production of consumers' goods is restricted, and great hardship is the consequence.  Technological progress frequently results in more unemployment rather than in an easing of the burden of work for all.  The profit motive, in conjunction with competition among capitalists, is responsible for an instability in the  accumulation  and utilization of capital which leads to increasingly severe depressions. Unlimited competition leads to a huge waste of labor, and to that crippling of the social consciousness of individuals.",Albert Einstein,success,Wikiquote – Albert Einstein,Physicist,Europe,1920s,male
"I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals.  In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child. The education of the individual, in addition to promoting his own innate abilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society.  Nevertheless, it is necessary to remember that a planned economy is not yet socialism. A planned economy as such may be accompanied by the complete enslavement of the individual.  The achievement of socialism requires the solution of some extremely difficult socio-political problems: how is it possible, in view of the far-reaching centralisation of political and economic power, to prevent bureaucracy from becoming all-powerful and overweening?  How can the rights of the individual be protected and therewith a democratic counterweight to the power of bureaucracy be assured?",Albert Einstein,leadership,Wikiquote – Albert Einstein,Physicist,Europe,1920s,male
"Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones.  The result of these developments is an  oligarchy  of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature.  The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.",Albert Einstein,success,Wikiquote – Albert Einstein,Physicist,Europe,1920s,male

Hinshaw, p. 62. From the  context  it seems that White did not specify whether he had heard Einstein himself say this or whether he was repeating a quote that had been passed along by someone else, so without a primary source the validity of this quote should be considered questionable.   Some have argued that elsewhere Einstein defined a ""miracle"" as a type of event he did not believe was possible— Einstein on Religion  by Max Jammer (1999) quotes on p. 89 from a 1931 conversation Einstein had with David Reichinstein, where Reichinstein brought up philosopher Arthur Liebert's argument that the indeterminism of quantum mechanics might allow for the possibility of miracles, and Einstein replied that Liebert's argument dealt ""with a domain in which lawful rationality [determinism] does not exist. A 'miracle,' however, is an exception from lawfulness; hence, there where lawfulness does not exist, also its exception, i.e., a miracle, cannot exist."" ("" Dort, wo eine Gesetzmässigkeit nicht vorhanden ist, kann auch ihre Ausnahme, d.h. ein Wunder, nicht existieren. "" D. Reichenstein,  Die Religion der Gebildeten  (1941), p. 21).  However, it is clear from the context that Einstein was stating only that miracles cannot exist in a domain (quantum mechanics) where lawful rationality does not exist.  He did not claim that miracles could never exist in any domain.  Indeed, Einstein clearly believed, as seen in many quotations above, that the universe was comprehensible and rational, but he also described this characteristic of the universe as a ""miracle"". In another example, he is quoted as claiming belief in a God, ""Who reveals Himself in the lawful harmony of the world.",Albert Einstein,motivation,Wikiquote – Albert Einstein,Physicist,Europe,1920s,male

"As discussed in  this entry from The Quote Investigator , the earliest published attribution of a similar quote to Einstein seems to have been in Gestalt therapist  Frederick S. Perls ' 1969 book  Gestalt Theory Verbatim , where he wrote on p. 33: ""As Albert Einstein once said to me: 'Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity.' But what is much more widespread than the actual stupidity is the playing stupid, turning off your ear, not listening, not seeing."" Perls also offered another variant in his 1972 book  In and Out the Garbage Pail , where he mentioned a meeting with Einstein and on  p. 52  quoted him saying: ""Two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I am not yet completely sure about the universe."" However, Perls had given yet another variant of this quote in an earlier book,  Ego, Hunger, and Aggression: a Revision of Freud's Theory and Method  (originally published 1942, although the Quote Investigator only checked that the quote appeared in the 1947 edition), where he attributed it not to Einstein but to a ""great astronomer"", writing: ""As modern times promote hasty eating to a large extent, it is not surprising to learn that a great astronomer said: 'Two things are infinite, as far as we know – the universe and human stupidity.' To-day we know that this statement is not quite correct. Einstein has proved that the universe is limited."" So, the later attributions in 1969 and 1972 may have been a case of faulty memory, or of intentionally trying to increase the authority of the quote by attributing it to Einstein. The quote itself may be a variant of a similar quote attributed even earlier to the philosopher  Ernest Renan , found for example in  The Public: Volume 18  from 1915, which says on  p. 1126 : ""He quotes the saying of Renan: it isn't the stars that give him an idea of infinity; it is man's stupidity."" (Other examples of similar attributions to Renan can be found on  this Google Books search .) Renan was French so this is presumably intended as a translation, but different sources give different versions of the supposed original French quote, such as "" La bêtise humaine est la seule chose qui donne une idée de l'infini "" (found for example in  Réflexions sur la vie, 1895-1898  by Remy de Gourmont from 1903,  p. 103 , along with several other early sources as seen in  this search ) and "" Ce n'est pas l'immensité de la voûte étoilée qui peut donner le plus complétement l'idée de l'infini, mais bien la bêtise humaine! "" (found in  Broad views, Volume 2  from 1904,  p. 465 ). Since these variants have not been found in Renan's own writings, they may represent false attributions as well. They may also be variants of an even older saying; for example, the 1880 book  Des vers  by  Guy de Maupassant  includes on  p. 9  a quote from a letter (dated February 19, 1880) by  Gustave Flaubert  where Flaubert writes "" Cependant, qui sait? La terre a des limites, mais la bêtise humaine est infinie! "" which translates to ""But who knows? The earth has its boundaries, but human stupidity is infinite!"" Similarly the 1887 book  Melanges  by  Jules-Paul Tardivel  includes on  p. 273  a piece said to have been written in 1880 in which he writes "" Aujourd'hui je sais qu'il n'y a pas de limites à la bêtise humaine, qu'elle est infinie "" which translates to ""today I know that there is no limit to human stupidity, it is infinite.",Albert Einstein,risk,Wikiquote – Albert Einstein,Physicist,Europe,1920s,male

"May have originated from Einstein's 25 May 1946 telegram quoted in  this New York Times story , where he wrote ""The unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking and we thus drift toward unparalleled catastrophe"", along with a later comment ""We need two hundred thousand dollars at once for a nation-wide campaign to let the people know that a new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to survive and move toward higher levels."" The  1959 English translation of Hans Hellmut Kirst's  The Seventh Day  modified the two quotes and left out the intermediate part about funding for a nation-wide campaign: ""The unleashed power of the atom has changed everything except our ways of thinking. Thus we are drifting toward a catastrophe beyond comparison. We shall require a substantially new manner of thinking if mankind is to survive"" (the original German version from 1957, titled  Keinner Kommt Davon , has the quote as ""Die entfesselte Macht des Atoms hat alles verändert, nur nicht unsere Denkweisen. Auf diese Weise gleiten wir einer Katastrophe ohnegleichen entgegen. Wir brauchen eine wesentlich neue Denkungsart, wenn die Menschheit am Leben bleiben soll."") This version is quoted verbatim in later sources like  p. 23  of a statement given by Dr. Charles E. Osgood to the US Committee on Foreign relations on 25 May 1966, and a  March 1979 story  on p. 82 of  The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists . Some also gave shortened versions which omitted the reference to ""the unleashed power of the atom"", as in the 1967 English translation of Josué de Castro's 1961 book  The Black Book of Hunger , which on  p. 4  attributed to Einstein the quote ""It has become essential that mankind formulate a new mode of thinking if it wishes to survive and to reach a higher level.""  Ram Dass ' 1974 book  The Only Dance There Is , which consisted of transcripts of talks he had given in 1970 and 1972, on  p. 38  attributed to Einstein the quote ""The world that we have made as a result of the level of thinking we have done thus far creates problems that we cannot solve at the same level as the level we created them at."" Ram Dass' speeches were generally given without notes so he may have just been paraphrasing one of the earlier versions of the quote, but some later sources repeated this exactly or with only a word or two different, like  p. 291  of David Dellinger's 1975 book  More Power Than We Know , or  p. 136  of the 1977 book  The End of the Road: A Citizen’s Guide to Transportation Problem-Solving  edited by Robert Golten et al., or  p. 47  of the 1986 edition of James L. Christian's book  Philosophy: An Introduction to the Art of Wondering.  Later authors gave shorter variants, like  The 1986 Annual: Developing Human Resources  which on  p. 185  attributed to Einstein the statement ""Our thinking has created problems which cannot be solved by that same level of thinking"", or the 1988 book  Take This Job and Love It  by Dennis Jaffe and Cynthia Scott which on  p. 60  attributed the quote ""the significant problems we have cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them"" (a nearly identical version with 'we face' instead of 'we have' can be found on  p. 42  of  Stephen Covey 's 1989 book  The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People ), and the 1989 book  Living in Love With Yourself  by Barry Ellsworth, which on  p. 27  attributed the quote ""the problems our world faces can never be solved by the same type of thinking that created them"", and Lynne Garnett's 1990 book  Finding the Great Creative You: A Seven Step Adventure  which on  p. 168  attributed the quote ""You can't solve a problem using the same kind of thinking that got you into the problem in the first place."" An  August 1993 post from alt.quotations  on  Usenet  uses the wording ""We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them"" (the earliest example found which includes the phrase 'using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them' as in the 1995 FBIS quote above), though the author, Peter Capek, says this is just a rough memory of the quote being asked about; this exact wording was repeated in  many later posts , with one of the earliest  from October 1993  citing Peter Capek as the source.",Albert Einstein,risk,Wikiquote – Albert Einstein,Physicist,Europe,1920s,male

Cummings repeated the quote in his 1922 science fiction novel  The Girl in the Golden Atom , available on Project Gutenberg  here  (according to  Science-Fiction: The Early Years  by Everett F. Bleiler,  p. 171 , the novel was a composite of two earlier stories published in 1919 and 1920).  Chapter V  contains the following paragraph:  The Big Business Man smiled. ""Time,"" he said, ""is what keeps everything from happening at once.""  The next-earliest source found for this quote is another book by Ray Cummings,  The Man Who Mastered Time  from 1929, and no published examples of the quote from authors other than Cummings can be found until the 1962  Film Facts: Volume 5  where it appears on  p. 48 . So, it seems likely that Ray Cummings is the real originator of this saying.",Albert Einstein,risk,Wikiquote – Albert Einstein,Physicist,Europe,1920s,male
"From William Bruce Cameron's  Informal Sociology: A Casual Introduction to Sociological Thinking  (1963), p. 13. The comment is part of a longer paragraph and does not appear in quotations in Cameron's book, and  other sources  such as  The Student's Companion to Sociology (p. 92)  attribute the quote to Cameron. A  number of recent books  claim that Einstein had a sign with these words in his office in Princeton, but until a reliable historical source can be found to support this, skepticism is warranted. The earliest source on Google Books that mentions the quote in association with Einstein and Princeton is Charles A. Garfield's 1986 book  Peak Performers: The New Heroes of American Business,  in which he wrote on p. 156:
 Albert Einstein liked to underscore the micro/macro partnership with a remark from Sir George Pickering that he chalked on the blackboard in his office at the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton: ""Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.",Albert Einstein,leadership,Wikiquote – Albert Einstein,Physicist,Europe,1920s,male
"According to  The Quote Verifier  (2006) by Ralph Keyes, Einstein never said any such thing. (According to p. 285 of the book's ""source notes"" Keyes checked  New Statesman  16 April 1965, which is commonly cited as the source of this quote. Some other books claim it is from  New Statesman  16 April 1955 and at least one has it as 1945, but a  Google Books search  with the date range restricted to 1900-1995 shows that all the earliest sources give it as 1965. This includes the earliest source located,  The Penguin Dictionary of Modern Quotations  from 1971, as can be verified by  this search .) Keyes notes that Einstein ""did use similar words to make a very different point"" when he wrote, in a 1954 letter to the editor at  The Reporter  magazine, ""If I would be a young man again and had to decide how to make my living, I would not try to become a scientist or scholar or teacher.

"The earliest published attribution of this quote to Einstein found on Google Books is the 1991 book  The Art of Computer Systems Performance Analysis  by Raj Jain (p. 507), but no source to Einstein's original writings is given and the quote itself is older; for example  New Guard: Volume 5, Issue 3  from 1961 says on  p. 312  ""Someone once said that if the facts do not fit the theory, then the facts must be changed"", while  Product engineering: Volume 29, Issues 9-12  from 1958 gives the slight variant on p. 9 ""There is an age-old adage, 'If the facts don't fit the theory, change the theory.' But too often it's easier to keep the theory and change the facts."" These quotes are themselves probably variants of an even earlier saying which used the phrasing ""so much the worse for the facts"", many examples of which can be seen in  this search ; for example, the 1851  American Whig Review, Volumes 13-14  says on  p. 488  ""However, Mr. Newhall may possibly have been of that casuist's opinion, who, when told that the facts of the matter did not bear out his hypothesis, said 'So much the worse for the facts.'"" The German idealist philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte circa 1800 did say ""If theory conflicts with the facts, so much the worse for the facts."" The Hungarian Marxist Georg Lukacs in his ""Tactics and Ethics"" (1923) echoed the same quotation.",Albert Einstein,failure,Wikiquote – Albert Einstein,Physicist,Europe,1920s,male

"Stein's book is the earliest published source located with that precise version of the quote, but the quote can be found in earlier  Usenet  posts such as  this one from 1995 , and other published variants of the quote using the words ""sacred gift"" can be found earlier. A  Google Books search  with the date range restricted to 1900-1990 shows only a handful in the 1980s and 1970s, and several of them attribute it to  The Metaphoric Mind  by Bob Samples (1976), which also seems to be the earliest published variant. Samples does not provide an exact quote, but writes on p. 26: ""Albert Einstein called the intuitive or metaphoric mind a sacred gift. He added that the rational mind was a faithful servant. It is paradoxical that in the context of modern life we have begun to worship the servant and defile the divine."" It seems as if the last sentence about worshipping the servant is just Samples' own comment (though in later variants it became part of the supposed quote), while the earlier sentences only paraphrase something that Samples claims Einstein to have said. Einstein had many quotes about the value of intuition and imagination, but the specific word ""gift"" can be found in a comment remembered by János Plesch in the section  Attributed in posthumous publications , ""When I examine myself and my methods of thought I come to the conclusion that the gift of fantasy has meant more to me than my talent for absorbing positive knowledge."" So, Bob Samples might have been paraphrasing that comment. Likewise Einstein had a number of quotes about the intellect being secondary to intuition, but the language of the intellect ""serving"" can be found in a quote from the  Out of My Later Years (1950)  section, ""And certainly we should take care not to make the intellect our god; it has, of course, powerful muscles, but no personality. It cannot lead, it can only serve; and it is not fastidious in its choice of a leader.",Albert Einstein,success,Wikiquote – Albert Einstein,Physicist,Europe,1920s,male

Before a leaf-bud has burst, its whole life acts; in the full-blown flower there is no more; in the leafless root there is no less. Its nature is satisfied, and it satisfies nature, in all moments alike. But man postpones or remembers; he does not live in the present, but with reverted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that surround him, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future.

If we live truly, we shall see truly. It is as easy for the strong man to be strong, as it is for the weak to be weak.

I cannot doubt that the high laws which each man sees implicated in those processes with which he is conversant, the stern ethics which sparkle on his chisel-edge, which are measured out by his plumb and foot-rule, which stand as manifest in the footing of the shop-bill as in the history of a state, — do recommend to him his trade, and though seldom named, exalt his business to his imagination.",Ralph Waldo Emerson,leadership,Wikiquote – Ralph Waldo Emerson,Philosopher,North America,1850s,male
"The league between  virtue  and  nature  engages all things to assume a hostile front to vice.  The beautiful laws and substances of the world persecute and whip the traitor. He finds that things are arranged for truth and benefit, but  there is no den in the wide world to hide a rogue. Commit a crime, and the earth is made of glass.  Commit a crime, and it seems as if a coat of snow fell on the ground, such as reveals in the woods the track of every partridge and fox and squirrel and mole. You cannot recall the spoken word, you cannot wipe out the foot-track, you cannot draw up the ladder, so as to leave no inlet or clew. Some damning circumstance always transpires. The laws and substances of nature — water, snow, wind, gravitation — become penalties to the thief.    On the other hand, the law holds with equal sureness for all right action. Love, and you shall be loved.  All love is mathematically just, as much as the two sides of an algebraic equation. The good man has absolute good, which like fire turns every thing to its own nature, so that you cannot do him any harm; but as the royal armies sent against Napoleon, when he approached, cast down their colors and from enemies became friends, so disasters of all kinds, as sickness, offence, poverty, prove benefactors: —",Ralph Waldo Emerson,failure,Wikiquote – Ralph Waldo Emerson,Philosopher,North America,1850s,male
"Our strength grows out of our weakness.  The indignation which arms itself with secret forces does not awaken until we are pricked and stung and sorely assailed.  A great man is always willing to be little.  Whilst he sits on the cushion of advantages, he goes to sleep. When he is pushed, tormented, defeated, he has a chance to learn something; he has been put on his wits, on his manhood; he has gained facts; learns his ignorance; is cured of the insanity of conceit; has got moderation and real skill. The wise man throws himself on the side of his assailants. It is more his interest than it is theirs to find his weak point. The wound cicatrizes and falls off from him like a dead skin, and when they would triumph, lo! he has passed on invulnerable. Blame is safer than praise. I hate to be defended in a newspaper. As long as all that is said is said against me, I feel a certain assurance of success. But as soon as honeyed words of praise are spoken for me, I feel as one that lies unprotected before his enemies.  In general, every evil to which we do not succumb is a benefactor.",Ralph Waldo Emerson,leadership,Wikiquote – Ralph Waldo Emerson,Philosopher,North America,1850s,male
"Men suffer all their life long, under the foolish superstition that they can be cheated. But it is as impossible for a man to be cheated by any one but himself, as for a thing to be and not to be at the same time.  There is a third silent party to all our bargains. The nature and soul of things takes on itself the guaranty of the fulfilment of every contract, so that honest service cannot come to loss. If you serve an ungrateful master, serve him the more. Put God in your debt. Every stroke shall be repaid. The longer the payment is withholden, the better for you; for compound interest on compound interest is the rate and usage of this exchequer.    The history of persecution is a history of endeavours to cheat nature, to make water run up hill, to twist a rope of sand. It makes no difference whether the actors be many or one, a  tyrant  or a  mob .  A mob is a society of bodies voluntarily bereaving themselves of reason, and traversing its work. The mob is man voluntarily descending to the nature of the beast. Its fit hour of activity is night. Its actions are insane like its whole constitution. It persecutes a principle; it would whip a right; it would tar and feather justice, by inflicting fire and outrage upon the houses and persons of those who have these. It resembles the prank of boys, who run with fire-engines to put out the ruddy aurora streaming to the stars.  The inviolate spirit turns their spite against the wrongdoers. The martyr cannot be dishonored.  Every lash inflicted is a tongue of fame; every prison, a more illustrious abode; every burned book or house enlightens the world; every suppressed or expunged word reverberates through the earth from side to side.  Hours of sanity and consideration are always arriving to communities, as to individuals, when the truth is seen, and the martyrs are justified.    Thus do all things preach the indifferency of circumstances. The man is all. Every thing has two sides, a good and an evil. Every advantage has its tax. I learn to be content.  But the doctrine of compensation is not the doctrine of indifferency.  The thoughtless say, on hearing these representations, — What boots it to do well? there is one event to good and evil; if I gain any good, I must pay for it; if I lose any good, I gain some other; all actions are indifferent.    There is a deeper fact in the soul than compensation, to wit, its own nature.  The soul is not a compensation, but a life.  The soul  is .  Under all this running sea of circumstance, whose waters ebb and flow with perfect balance, lies the aboriginal abyss of real Being. Essence, or God, is not a relation, or a part, but the whole. Being is the vast affirmative, excluding negation, self-balanced, and swallowing up all relations, parts, and times within itself. Nature, truth, virtue, are the influx from thence. Vice is the absence or departure of the same.",Ralph Waldo Emerson,risk,Wikiquote – Ralph Waldo Emerson,Philosopher,North America,1850s,male
"We feel defrauded of the retribution due to evil acts, because the criminal adheres to his vice and contumacy, and does not come to a crisis or judgment anywhere in visible nature. There is no stunning confutation of his nonsense before men and angels.  Has he therefore outwitted the  law ? Inasmuch as he carries the malignity and the lie with him, he so far deceases from nature.  In some manner there will be a demonstration of the wrong to the understanding also; but should we not see it, this deadly deduction makes square the eternal account.    Neither can it be said, on the other hand, that the gain of  rectitude  must be bought by any loss. There is no penalty to  virtue ; no penalty to wisdom; they are proper additions of being.  In a virtuous action, I properly  am ; in a virtuous act, I add to the world; I plant into deserts conquered from Chaos and Nothing, and see the  darkness  receding on the limits of the horizon. There can be no excess to  love ; none to  knowledge ; none to  beauty , when these attributes are considered in the  purest  sense.  The  soul  refuses limits, and always affirms an  Optimism , never a  Pessimism .    His life is a progress, and not a station. His instinct is trust.  Our  instinct  uses ""more"" and ""less"" in application to man, of the  presence of the soul , and not of its absence; the brave man is greater than the coward; the true, the benevolent, the wise, is more a man, and not less, than the fool and  knave .  There is no tax on the good of virtue; for that is the incoming of  God  himself, or absolute existence, without any comparative. Material good has its tax, and if it came without desert or sweat, has no root in me, and the next wind will blow it away.  But all the good of nature is the soul's, and may be had, if paid for in nature's lawful coin, that is, by labor which the heart and the head allow.  I no longer wish to meet a good I do not earn, for example, to find a pot of buried gold, knowing that it brings with it new burdens.  I do not wish more external goods, — neither possessions, nor honors, nor powers, nor persons.  The gain is apparent; the tax is certain. But there is no tax on the knowledge that the compensation exists, and that it is not desirable to dig up treasure.  Herein I rejoice with a serene eternal peace. I contract the boundaries of possible mischief. I learn the wisdom of  St. Bernard , — ""Nothing can work me damage except myself; the harm that I sustain I carry about with me, and never am a real sufferer but by my own fault.",Ralph Waldo Emerson,success,Wikiquote – Ralph Waldo Emerson,Philosopher,North America,1850s,male

The war rages not only in battle-fields, in national councils and ecclesiastical synods, but agitates every man's bosom with opposing advantages every hour. On rolls the old world meantime, and now one, now the other gets the day, and still the fight renews itself as if for the first time, under new names and hot personalities.

"In the famous dispute with the  Nominalists , the  Realists  had a good deal of  reason . General  ideas  are  essences . They are our  gods : they round and ennoble the most partial and sordid way of living. Our proclivity to details cannot quite degrade our life, and divest it of  poetry .  The day-laborer is reckoned as standing at the foot of the social scale, yet he is saturated with the laws of the world. His measures are the hours; morning and night, solstice and equinox, geometry, astronomy, and all the lovely accidents of nature play through his mind.  Money , which represents the prose of life, and which is hardly spoken of in parlors without an apology, is, in its effects and laws, as beautiful as roses. Property keeps the accounts of the world, and is always moral. The property will be found where the labor, the wisdom, and the virtue have been in nations, in classes, and (the whole life-time considered, with the compensations) in the individual also.

"The end and the means, the gamester and the game, — life is made up of the intermixture and reaction of these two amicable powers, whose marriage appears beforehand monstrous, as each denies and tends to abolish the other. We must reconcile the contradictions as we can, but their discord and their concord introduce wild absurdities into our thinking and speech.  No sentence will hold the whole truth, and the only way in which we can be just, is by giving ourselves the lie; Speech is better than silence; silence is better than speech; — All things are in contact; every atom has a sphere of repulsion; — Things are, and are not, at the same time; — and the like.  All the universe over, there is but one thing, this old Two-Face, creator-creature, mind-matter, right-wrong, of which any proposition may be affirmed or denied. Very fitly therefore I assert that every  man  is a partialist; that  nature  secures him as an instrument by self-conceit, preventing the tendencies to  religion  and  science ; and now further assert, that, each man's  genius  being nearly and affectionately explored, he is justified in his  individuality , as his nature is found to be immense; and now I add that every man is a  universalist  also, and, as our  earth , whilst it spins on its own axis, spins all the  time  around the  sun  through the celestial spaces, so the least of its  rational   children , the most dedicated to his private affair, works out, though as it were under a disguise, the universal problem.  We  fancy  men are individuals; so are  pumpkins ; but every pumpkin in the field, goes through every point of pumpkin  history .  The rabid democrat, as soon as he is senator and rich man, has ripened beyond possibility of sincere radicalism, and unless he can resist the sun, he must be conservative the remainder of his days.

"The key to the period appeared to be that the mind had become aware of itself. Men grew reflective and intellectual. There was a new consciousness.  The former generations acted under the belief that a shining social prosperity was the beatitude of man, and sacrificed uniformly the citizen to the State. The modern mind believed that the nation existed for the individual, for the guardianship and education of every man. This idea, roughly written in revolutions and national movements, in the mind of the philosopher had far more precision; the individual is the world.    This perception is a sword such as was never drawn before. It divides and detaches bone and marrow, soul and body, yea, almost the man from himself.  It is the age of severance, of dissociation, of freedom, of analysis, of detachment. Every man for himself. The public speaker disclaims speaking for any other; he answers only for himself. The social sentiments are weak; the sentiment of patriotism is weak; veneration is low; the natural affections feebler than they were. People grow philosophical about native land and parents and. relations. There is an universal resistance to ties rand ligaments once supposed essential to civil society. The new race is stiff, heady and rebellious; they are fanatics in freedom; they hate tolls, taxes, turnpikes, banks, hierarchies, governors, yea, almost laws. They have a neck of unspeakable tenderness; it winces at a hair. They rebel against theological as against political dogmas; against mediation, or saints, or any nobility in the unseen.   The age tends to solitude. The association of the time is accidental and momentary and hypocritical, the detachment intrinsic and progressive.

"Of course if we make good things, it is not only to the credit of science; it is also to the credit of the moral choice which led us to good work.   Scientific knowledge is an enabling power to do either good or bad — but it does not carry instructions on how to use it.   Such power has evident value — even though the power may be negated by what one does with it. I learned a way of expressing this common human problem on a trip to  Honolulu .  In a  Buddhist  temple there, the man in charge explained a little bit about the Buddhist religion for  tourists , and then ended his talk by telling them he had something to say to them that they would never forget — and I have never forgotten it.  It was a proverb of the Buddhist religion: To every man is given the key to the gates of heaven; the same key opens the gates of hell. What then, is the value of the key to heaven?  It is true that if we lack clear instructions that enable us to determine which is the gate to heaven and which the gate to hell, the key may be a dangerous object to use.

"The scientist has a lot of experience with ignorance and doubt and uncertainty, and this experience is of very great importance, I think.  When a scientist doesn't know the answer to a problem, he is ignorant. When he has a hunch as to what the result is, he is uncertain. And when he is pretty darn sure of what the result is going to be, he is still in some doubt.  We have found it of paramount importance that in order to progress we must recognize our ignorance and leave room for doubt. Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty — some most unsure, some nearly sure, but none  absolutely  certain.  Now, we  scientists  are used to this, and we take it for granted that it is perfectly consistent to be unsure, that it is possible to live and  not  know. But I don't know whether everyone realizes this is true.  Our freedom to doubt was born out of a struggle against authority in the early days of science. It was a very deep and strong struggle: permit us to question — to doubt — to not be sure.

In the impetuous youth of humanity, we can make grave errors that can stunt our growth for a long time.  This we will do if we say we have the answers now, so young and ignorant as we are.   If we suppress all discussion, all criticism, proclaiming ""This is the answer, my friends; man is saved!"" we will doom humanity for a long time to the chains of authority, confined to the limits of our present imagination.  It has been done so many times before.    ...It is our responsibility as scientists, knowing the great progress which comes from a satisfactory philosophy of ignorance, the great progress which is the fruit of freedom of thought, to proclaim the value of this freedom; to teach how doubt is not to be feared but welcomed and discussed; and to demand this freedom as our duty to all coming generations.",Richard Feynman,leadership,Wikiquote – Richard Feynman,Physicist,North America,1960s,male

"...Dirac discovered the correct laws for relativity quantum mechanics simply by guessing the equation.   The method of guessing the equation seems to be a pretty effective way of guessing new laws . This shows again that mathematics is a deep way of expressing nature, and any attempt to express nature in philosophical principles, or in seat-of-the-pants mechanical feelings, is not an efficient way. ...It always bothers me that, according to the laws as we understand them today, it takes a computing machine an infinite number of logical operations to figure out what goes on in no matter how tiny a region of space, and no matter how tiny a region of time. How can all that be going on in that tiny space? Why should it take an infinite amount of logic to figure out what one tiny piece of space/time is going to do? So I have often made the hypotheses that ultimately physics will not require a mathematical statement, that in the end the machinery will be revealed, and the laws will turn out to be simple, like the chequer board with all its apparent complexities.",Richard Feynman,risk,Wikiquote – Richard Feynman,Physicist,North America,1960s,male

Since 1 part in 100,000 would imply that one could put a Shuttle up each day for 300 years expecting to lose only one, we could properly ask ""What is the cause of management's fantastic  faith  in the machinery?""    We have also found that certification criteria used in Flight Readiness Reviews often develop a gradually decreasing strictness. The argument that the same risk was flown before without failure is often accepted as an argument for the safety of accepting it again. Because of this, obvious  weaknesses  are accepted again and again, sometimes without a sufficiently serious attempt to remedy them, or to delay a flight because of their continued presence.",Richard Feynman,failure,Wikiquote – Richard Feynman,Physicist,North America,1960s,male
"If we are to replace standard numerical probability usage with engineering judgment, why do we find such an enormous disparity between the management estimate and the judgment of the engineers? It would appear that, for whatever purpose, be it for internal or external consumption, the management of  NASA  exaggerates the reliability of its product, to the point of fantasy.",Richard Feynman,risk,Wikiquote – Richard Feynman,Physicist,North America,1960s,male
"The acceptance and success of these flights is taken as evidence of safety. But erosion and blow-by are not what the design expected. They are warnings that something is  wrong . The equipment is not operating as expected, and therefore there is a  danger  that it can operate with even wider deviations in this unexpected and not thoroughly  understood  way.  The  fact  that this danger did not lead to a catastrophe before is no guarantee that it will not the next time, unless it is completely understood. When playing Russian roulette the fact that the first shot got off safely is little comfort for the next.  The origin and consequences of the erosion and blow-by were not understood. They did not occur equally on all flights and all joints; sometimes more, and sometimes less.  Why not sometime, when whatever conditions determined it were right, still more leading to catastrophe?   In spite of these variations from case to case, officials behaved as if they understood it, giving apparently logical arguments to each other often depending on the "" success "" of previous flights.",Richard Feynman,failure,Wikiquote – Richard Feynman,Physicist,North America,1960s,male
"There was no way, without full understanding, that one could have confidence that conditions the next time might not produce erosion three times more severe than the time before. Nevertheless, officials fooled themselves into thinking they had such understanding and confidence, in spite of the peculiar variations from case to case. A mathematical model was made to calculate erosion. This was a model based not on physical understanding but on empirical curve fitting.",Richard Feynman,risk,Wikiquote – Richard Feynman,Physicist,North America,1960s,male
"Let us make recommendations to ensure that NASA officials deal in a world of reality in understanding technological weaknesses and imperfections well enough to be actively trying to eliminate them.  They must live in reality in comparing the costs and utility of the Shuttle to other methods of entering space. And they must be realistic in making contracts, in estimating costs, and the difficulty of the projects. Only realistic flight schedules should be proposed, schedules that have a reasonable chance of being met. If in this way the government would not support them, then so be it. NASA owes it to the citizens from whom it asks support to be frank, honest, and informative, so that these citizens can make the wisest decisions for the use of their limited resources.     For a successful  technology ,  reality  must take precedence over public relations, for  nature  cannot be fooled.",Richard Feynman,leadership,Wikiquote – Richard Feynman,Physicist,North America,1960s,male

"Though the majority of the Mussalmans of India and the Hindus belong to the same 'stock', the religious environment has made them different. I believe and I have noticed too that thought transforms man’s features as well as character. The Sikhs are the most recent illustration of the fact. The Mussalman being generally in a minority has as a class developed into a bully. Moreover being heir to fresh traditions he exhibits the virility of a comparatively new system of life. Though in my opinion non-violence has a predominant place in the Koran, the thirteen hundred years of imperialistic expansion has made the Mussalmans fighters as a body. They are therefore, aggressive. Bullying is the natural excrescence of an aggressive spirit. The Hindu has an age old civilisation. He is essentially non-violent. His civilisation has passed through the experiences that the two recent ones are still passing through. If Hinduism was ever imperialistic in the modern sense of the term, it has outlived its imperialism and has either deliberately or as a matter of course given it up. Predominance of the non-violent spirit has restricted the use of arms to a small minority, which must always be subordinate to a civil power highly spiritual, learned and selfless.",Mahatma Gandhi,leadership,Wikiquote – Mahatma Gandhi,Activist,Asia,1940s,male
"The Hindus as a body are therefore not equipped for fighting. But not having retained their spiritual training, they have forgotten the use of an effective substitute for arms and not knowing their use nor having an aptitude for them, they have become docile to the point of timidity or cowardice. This vice is therefore a natural excrescence of gentleness. Holding this view, I do not think that the Hindu exclusiveness, bad as it undoubtedly is, has much to do with the Hindu timidity. Hence also my disbelief in Akhadas as a means of self-defence. I prize them for physical culture but, for self-defence I would restore the spiritual culture. The best and most lasting self-defence is self-purification. I refuse to be lifted off my feet because of the scares that haunt us today. If Hindus would but believe in themselves and work in accordance with their traditions, they will have no reason to fear bullying. The moment they recommence the real spiritual training the Mussalman will respond. He cannot help it. If I can get together a band of young Hindus with faith in themselves and therefore faith in the Mussalmans, the band will become a shield for the vneaker ones. They (the young Hindus) will teach how to die without killing. I know no other way. When our ancestors saw affliction surrounding them, they went in for tapasya purification. They realised the helplessness of the flesh and in their helplessnes they prayed till they compelled the Maker to obey their call. 'Oh yes,' says my Hindu friend,‘but then God sent some one to wield arms. I am not concerned with denying the truth of the retort. All I say to the friend is that as a Hindu he may not ignore the cause and secure the result. It will be time to fight, when we have done enough lapasya. Are we purified enough I ask? Have we even done willing penance for the sin of untouchability, let alone the personal purity of individuals? Are our religious preceptors all that they should be? We are beating the air whilst we simply concentrate our attention upon picking holes in the Mussalmam conduct. As with the English-man, so with the Mussalman. If our professions are true, we should find it infinitely less difficult to conquer the Mussalman than the English. But Hindus whisper to me that they have hope of the Englishman hut none of the Mussalman. I say to them,'if you have no hope of the Mussalman, your hope of the  Englishman  is foredoomed to failure.",Mahatma Gandhi,motivation,Wikiquote – Mahatma Gandhi,Activist,Asia,1940s,male

"Interview to the Press"" in Karachi about the execution of  Bhagat Singh  (23 March 1931); published in  Young India  (2 April 1931), reprinted in  Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi Online  Vol. 51 . Gandhi begins by making a statement on his failure ""to bring about the commutation of the death sentence of Bhagat Singh and his friends."" He is asked two questions. First: ""Do you not think it impolitic to forgive a government which has been guilty of a thousand murders?"" Gandhi replies: ""I do not know a single instance where forgiveness has been found so wanting as to be impolitic."" In a follow-up question, Gandhi is asked: ""But no country has ever shown such forgiveness as India is showing to Britain?"" Gandhi replies: ""That does not affect my reply. What is true of individuals is true of nations. One cannot forgive too much. The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.",Mahatma Gandhi,failure,Wikiquote – Mahatma Gandhi,Activist,Asia,1940s,male

Man's happiness really lies in contentment. He who is discontented, however much he possesses, becomes a slave to his desires. And there is really no slavery equal to that of the desires. All the sages have declared from the house-tops that man can be his own worst enemy as well as his best friend. To be free or to be a slave lies in his own hands.

All distinctions between combatants and noncombatants have been abolished. No one and nothing is to be spared. Lying has been reduced to an art.  Britain was to defend small nationalities. One by one they have vanished, at least for the time being.  It is also a warning. It is a warning that, if nobody reads the writing on the wall, man will be reduced to the state of the beast, whom he is shaming by his manners.  I read the writing when the hostilities broke out.

Your soldiers are doing the same work of destruction as the Germans.  The only difference is that perhaps yours are not as thorough as the Germans. If that be so, yours will soon acquire the same thoroughness as theirs, if not much greater. On no other condition can you win the war. In other words, you will have to be more ruthless than the Nazis.  No cause, however just, can warrant the indiscriminate slaughter that is going on minute by minute.

I hope you do not wish to enter into such an undignified competition with the Nazis.  I venture to present you with a nobler and a braver way, worthy of the bravest soldier.  I want you to fight Nazism without arms, or, if I am to retain the military terminology, with non-violent arms.'  I would like you to lay down the arms you have as being useless for saving you or humanity.   You will invite Herr  Hitler  and Signor  Mussolini  to take what they want of the countries you call your possessions. Let them take possession of your beautiful island, with your many beautiful buildings. You will give all these, but neither your souls, nor your minds. If these gentlemen choose to occupy your homes, you will vacate them.  If they do not give you free passage out, you will allow yourself, man, woman and child, to be slaughtered, but you will refuse to owe allegiance to them.

In that 1979 book, Schumacher said he saw Gandhi make this remark in a filmed record of his quizzing by reporters as he disembarked in Southampton while visiting England in 1930. Gandhi did not visit England in 1930. He did attend a roundtable conference on India's future in London the following year. Standard biographies of Gandhi do not report his making any such quip as he disembarked. Most often it has been revised to be Gandhi's assessment of ""Western"" civilization: ""I think it would be a good idea.""

Whence such a veneration on their part for a man, were he simply, as represented by the Synoptics, a poor, unknown Jewish carpenter from Nazareth? As an incarnated God there is no single record of him on this earth capable of withstanding the critical examination of science; as one of the greatest reformers, an inveterate enemy of every theological dogmatism, a persecutor of bigotry, a teacher of one of the most sublime codes of ethics, Jesus is one of the grandest and most clearly-defined figures on the panorama of human history. His age may, with every day, be receding farther and farther back into the gloomy and hazy mists of the past; and his theology — based on human fancy and supported by untenable dogmas may, nay, must with every day lose more of its unmerited prestige; alone the grand figure of the philosopher and moral reformer instead of growing paler will become with every century more pronounced and more clearly defined.

If I am happy in spite of my deprivations, if my happiness is so deep that it is a faith, so thoughtful that it becomes a philosophy of life, — if, in short, I am an optimist, my testimony to the creed of optimism is worth hearing.",Helen Keller,success,Wikiquote – Helen Keller,Author,North America,1920s,female
"Once I knew the depth where no hope was, and darkness lay on the face of all things. Then love came and set my soul free. Once I knew only darkness and stillness. Now I know hope and joy. Once I fretted and beat myself against the wall that shut me in. Now I rejoice in the consciousness that I can think, act and attain heaven. My life was without past or future; death, the  pessimist  would say, ""a consummation devoutly to be wished."" But a little word from the fingers of another fell into my hand that clutched at emptiness, and my heart leaped to the rapture of living. Night fled before the day of thought, and love and joy and hope came up in a passion of obedience to knowledge. Can anyone who has escaped such captivity, who has felt the thrill and glory of freedom, be a pessimist?",Helen Keller,success,Wikiquote – Helen Keller,Author,North America,1920s,female

He loved the good for its own sake. Like many great spirits he accepted his place in the world, and confided himself childlike to a higher power, believing that it worked through his hands and predominated in his being. He trusted implicitly, and that is what I do. Deep, solemn optimism, it seems to me, should spring from this firm belief in the presence of God in the individual; not a remote, unapproachable governor of the universe, but a God who is very near every one of us, who is present not only in earth, sea and sky, but also in every pure and noble impulse of our hearts, 'the source and centre of all minds, their only point of rest.",Helen Keller,motivation,Wikiquote – Helen Keller,Author,North America,1920s,female

Ancient prejudice of man against his brother-man wavers and retreats before the radiance of a more generous sentiment, which will not sacrifice men to forms, or rob them of the comfort and strength they find in their own beliefs.

"The country is governed for the richest, for the corporations, the bankers, the land speculators, and for the exploiters of labour. Surely we must free men and women together before we can free women. The majority of mankind are working people. So long as their fair demands -- the ownership and control of their lives and livelihood -- are set at naught, we can have neither men's rights nor women's rights. The majority of mankind are ground down by industrial oppression in order that the small remnant may live in ease. How can women hope to help themselves while we and our brothers are helpless against the powerful organizations which modern parties represent and which contrive to rule the people? They rule the people because they own the means of physical life, land, and tools, and the nourishers of intellectual life, the press, the church, and the school. You say that the conduct of the woman suffragists is being disgracefully misrepresented by the British press. Here in America the leading newspapers misrepresent in every possible way the struggles of toiling men and women who seek relief. News that reflects ill upon the employers is skillfully concealed -- news of dreadful conditions under which labourers are forced to produce, news of thousands of men maimed in mills and mines and left without compensation, news of famines and strikes, news of thousands of women driven to a life of shame, news of little children compelled to labour before their hands are ready to drop their toys.

They insist that there can be no peace until the workers organize as a class, take possession of the resources of the earth and the machinery of production and distribution and abolish the wage system.

How was it possible, I asked myself, to walk for an hour through the woods and see nothing worthy of note?  I who cannot see find hundreds of things to interest me through mere touch.  I feel the delicate symmetry of a leaf. I pass my hands lovingly about the smooth skin of a silver birch, or the rough, shaggy bark of a pine.

If only this  capitalistic   New York   newspaper  had treated him more kindly; if only Marx had remained a foreign correspondent, history might have been different.

"Without  debate , without  criticism , no Administration and no country can succeed — and no  republic  can survive.

And that is why our press was protected by the  First Amendment  — the only business in America specifically protected by the Constitution- - not primarily to amuse and entertain, not to emphasize the trivial and the sentimental, not to simply ""give the public what it wants"" — but to inform, to arouse, to reflect, to state our dangers and our opportunities, to indicate our crises and our choices, to lead, mold, educate and sometimes even anger public opinion.   This means greater coverage and analysis of international news — for it is no longer far away and foreign but close at hand and local. It means greater attention to improved understanding of the news as well as improved transmission.

"The great battleground for the defense and expansion of freedom today is  the whole southern half of the globe-- Asia ,  Latin America ,  Africa  and the  Middle East -- the lands of the rising peoples. Their revolution is the greatest in human  history . They seek an end to  injustice ,  tyranny , and exploitation. More than an end, they seek a beginning. And theirs is a revolution which we would support regardless of the  Cold War , and regardless of which political or economic route they should choose to freedom. For the adversaries of freedom did not create the revolution; nor did they create the conditions which compel it. But they are seeking to ride the crest of its wave--to capture it for themselves. Yet their aggression is more often concealed than open. They have fired no missiles; and their troops are seldom seen. They send arms, agitators, aid, technicians and propaganda to every troubled area. But where fighting is required, it is usually done by others--by guerrillas striking at night, by assassins striking alone --assassins who have taken the lives of four thousand civil officers in the last twelve months in  Vietnam  alone-- by subversives and saboteurs and  insurrectionists , who in some cases control whole areas inside of independent nations. They possess a powerful intercontinental striking force, large forces for conventional war, a well-trained underground in nearly every country, the power to conscript talent and manpower for any purpose, the capacity for quick decisions, a closed society without dissent or free information, and long experience in the techniques of violence and subversion. They make the most of their scientific successes, their economic progress and their pose as a foe of colonialism and friend of popular revolution. They prey on unstable or unpopular governments, unsealed, or unknown boundaries, unfilled hopes, convulsive change, massive poverty, illiteracy, unrest and frustration. With these formidable weapons, the adversaries of freedom plan to consolidate their territory--to exploit, to control, and finally to destroy the hopes of the world's newest nations; and they have ambition to do it before the end of this decade. It is a contest of will and purpose as well as force and violence--a battle for minds and souls as well as lives and territory. And in that contest, we cannot stand aside. We stand, as we have always stood from our earliest beginnings, for the  independence  and  equality  of all nations. This nation was born of  revolution  and raised in  freedom . And we do not intend to leave an open road for  despotism .",John F Kennedy,risk,Wikiquote – John F Kennedy,President,North America,1960s,male
There is no single simple policy which meets this challenge. Experience has taught us that no one nation has the power or the wisdom to solve all the problems of the world or manage its revolutionary tides-that extending our commitments does not always increase our security--that any initiative carries with it the risk of a temporary defeat--that  nuclear weapons  cannot prevent subversion--that no free people can be kept free without will and energy of their own-- and that no two nations or situations are exactly alike.,John F Kennedy,leadership,Wikiquote – John F Kennedy,President,North America,1960s,male

I stress the strength of our economy because it is essential to the strength of our nation. And what is true in our case is true in the case of other countries. Their strength in the struggle for freedom depends on the strength of their economic and their social progress. We would be badly mistaken to consider their problems in military terms alone. For  no amount of arms and armies can help stabilize those governments which are unable or unwilling to achieve social and economic reform and development. Military pacts cannot help nations whose social injustice and economic chaos invite insurgency and penetration and subversion.

Where the will is present and only capacity is lacking,  our Military Assistance Program  can be of help. But this program, like economic assistance, needs a new emphasis. It  cannot be extended without regard to the social, political and military reforms essential to internal respect and stability. The equipment and training provided must be tailored to legitimate local needs and to our own foreign and military policies, not to our supply of military stocks or a local leader's desire for military display.

"This Administration has been looking hard at exactly what  civil defense  can and cannot do. It  cannot be obtained cheaply. It cannot give an assurance of blast protection that will be proof against surprise attack or guaranteed against obsolescence or destruction. And it cannot deter a nuclear attack. We will deter an enemy from making a nuclear attack only if our retaliatory power is so strong and so invulnerable that he knows he would be destroyed by our response. If we have that strength, civil defense is not needed to deter an attack. If we should ever lack it, civil defense would not be an adequate substitute. But this deterrent concept assumes rational calculations by rational men. And the history of this planet, and particularly the history of the  20th century , is sufficient to remind us of the possibilities of an irrational attack, a miscalculation, an accidental war, for a war of escalation in which the stakes by each side gradually increase to the point of maximum danger which cannot be either foreseen or deterred. It is on this basis that civil defense can be readily justifiable--as insurance for the civilian population in case of an enemy miscalculation. It is insurance we trust will never be needed--but insurance which we could never forgive ourselves for foregoing in the event of catastrophe.  Once the validity of this concept is recognized, there is no point in delaying the initiation of a nation-wide long-range program of identifying present fallout shelter capacity and providing shelter in new and existing structures.  Such a program would protect millions of people against the hazards of radioactive fallout in the event of large-scale nuclear attack.  Effective performance of the entire program not only requires new legislative authority and more funds, but also sound organizational arrangements.",John F Kennedy,risk,Wikiquote – John F Kennedy,President,North America,1960s,male

I believe we possess all the resources and talents necessary.

We have never specified long-range goals on an urgent time schedule, or managed our resources and our time so as to insure theft fulfillment.   Recognizing the head start obtained by the Soviets with their large rocket engines, which gives them many months of lead-time, and recognizing the likelihood that they will exploit this lead for some time to come in still more impressive successes, we nevertheless are required to make new efforts on our own. For  while we cannot guarantee that we shall one day be first, we can guarantee that any failure to make this effort will make us last. We take an additional risk by making it in full view of the world, but as shown by  feat  of  astronaut Shepard , this very risk enhances our stature when we are successful.

"These burdens and frustrations are accepted by most Americans with maturity and understanding. They may long for the days when war meant charging up  San Juan Hill -or when our isolation was guarded by two oceans — or when the atomic bomb was ours alone — or when much of the industrialized world depended upon our resources and our aid. But they now know that those days are gone — and that gone with them are the old policies and the old complacency's. And they know, too, that  we must make the best of our new problems and our new opportunities, whatever the risk and the cost.    But there are others who cannot bear the burden of a long twilight struggle. They lack confidence in our long-run capacity to survive and succeed. Hating communism, yet they see communism in the long run, perhaps, as the wave of the future. And they want some quick and easy and final and cheap solution — now.   There are two groups of these frustrated citizens, far apart in their views yet very much alike in their approach. On the one hand are those who urge upon us what I regard to be the pathway of surrender-appeasing our enemies, compromising our commitments, purchasing peace at any price, disavowing our arms, our friends, our obligations. If their view had prevailed, the world of free choice would be smaller today.   On the other hand are those who urge upon us what I regard to be the pathway of war: equating  negotiations  with appeasement and substituting rigidity for firmness. If their view had prevailed, we would be at war today, and in more than one place.   It is a curious fact that each of these extreme opposites resembles the other. Each believes that we have only two choices: appeasement or war, suicide or surrender, humiliation or holocaust, to be either Red or dead. Each side sees only ""hard"" and ""soft"" nations, hard and soft policies, hard and soft men. Each believes that any departure from its own course inevitably leads to the other: one group believes that any peaceful solution means appeasement; the other believes that any arms build-up means war. One group regards everyone else as warmongers, the other regards everyone else as appeasers. Neither side admits that its path will lead to disaster — but neither can tell us how or where to draw the line once we descend the slippery slopes of appeasement or constant intervention.   In short, while both extremes profess to be the true realists of our time, neither could be more unrealistic. While both claim to be doing the nation a service, they could do it no greater disservice. This kind of talk and  easy solutions to difficult problems, if believed, could inspire a lack of confidence among our people when they must all — above all else — be united in recognizing the long and difficult days that lie ahead. It could inspire uncertainty among our allies when above all else they must be confident in us. And even more dangerously, it could, if believed, inspire doubt among our adversaries when they must above all be convinced that we will defend our vital interests.    The essential fact that both of these groups fail to grasp is that  diplomacy and defense are not substitutes for one another. Either alone would fail. A willingness to resist force, unaccompanied by a willingness to talk, could provoke belligerence — while a willingness to talk, unaccompanied by a willingness to resist force, could invite disaster.",John F Kennedy,leadership,Wikiquote – John F Kennedy,President,North America,1960s,male
"But  as long as we know what comprises our vital interests and our long-range goals, we have nothing to fear from  negotiations  at the appropriate time, and nothing to gain by refusing to take part in them.  At a time when a single clash could escalate overnight into a holocaust of mushroom clouds,  a great power does not prove its firmness by leaving the task of exploring the other's intentions to sentries or those without full responsibility. Nor can ultimate weapons rightfully be employed, or the ultimate sacrifice rightfully demanded of our citizens, until every reasonable solution has been explored.

"If vital interests under duress can be preserved by peaceful means,  negotiations  will find that out.

And if negotiations are to take place, this nation cannot abdicate to its adversaries the task of choosing the forum and the framework and the time.",John F Kennedy,risk,Wikiquote – John F Kennedy,President,North America,1960s,male
"No one should be under the illusion that negotiations for the sake of negotiations always advance the cause of peace. If for lack of preparation they break up in bitterness, the prospects of peace have been endangered. If they are made a forum for propaganda or a cover for aggression, the processes of peace have been abused.  But it is a test of our national maturity to accept the fact that negotiations are not a contest spelling victory or defeat. They may succeed — they may fail. They are likely to be successful only if both sides reach an agreement which both regard as preferable to the status quo — an agreement in which each side can consider its own situation to be improved. And this is most difficult to obtain. But,  while we shall negotiate freely, we shall not negotiate freedom.  Our answer to the classic question of  Patrick Henry  is still no-life is not so dear, and peace is not so precious, ""as to be purchased at the price of chains and  slavery ."" And that is our answer even though, for the first time since the ancient battles between Greek city-states, war entails the threat of total annihilation, of everything we know, of society itself.  For to save mankind's future freedom, we must face up to any risk that is necessary. We will always seek peace — but we will never surrender.",John F Kennedy,leadership,Wikiquote – John F Kennedy,President,North America,1960s,male

"But history may well remember this as a week for an act of lesser immediate impact, and that is  the decision by the United States and the Soviet Union to seek concrete agreements on the joint exploration of space. Experience has taught us that an agreement to negotiate does not always mean a negotiated agreement. But should such a joint effort be realized, its significance could well be tremendous for us all. In terms of space science, our combined knowledge and efforts can benefit the people of all the nations: joint weather satellites to provide more ample warnings against destructive storms--joint communications systems to draw the world more closely together--and cooperation in space medicine research and space tracking operations to speed the day when man will go to the moon and beyond. But the scientific gains from such a joint effort would offer, I believe, less realized returns than the gains for world peace. For a  cooperative Soviet-American effort  in space science and exploration would emphasize the interests that must unite us, rather than those that always divide us. It offers us an area in which the stale and sterile dogmas of the cold war could be literally left a quarter of a million miles behind. And it would remind us on both sides that knowledge, not hate, is the passkey to the future--that knowledge transcends national antagonisms--that it speaks a universal language--that it is the possession not of a single class, or of a single nation or a single ideology, but of all mankind.",John F Kennedy,leadership,Wikiquote – John F Kennedy,President,North America,1960s,male

One of the great bottlenecks for this country's  economic growth  in this decade will be the shortage of doctorates in  mathematics ,  engineering , and  physics ; a serious shortage with a great demand and an under-supply of highly trained manpower. We can and must step up the development of our natural resources.  But the most direct and significant kind of Federal action aiding economic growth is to make possible an increase in private consumption and investment demand--to cut the fetters which hold back private spending. In the past, this could be done in part by the increased use of credit and monetary tools, but our balance of payments situation today places limits on our use of those tools for expansion. It could also be done by increasing Federal expenditures more rapidly than necessary, but such a course would soon demoralize both the Government and our economy.

In short, to increase demand and lift the economy, the Federal Government's most useful role is not to rush into a program of excessive increases in public expenditures, but to expand the incentives and opportunities for private expenditures.

"Third,  the new tax bill should improve both the equity and the simplicity of our present tax system. This means the enactment of long-needed tax reforms, a broadening of the tax base and the elimination or modification of many special tax privileges. These steps are not only needed to recover lost revenue and thus make possible a larger cut in present rates; they are also tied directly to our goal of greater growth. For the present patchwork of special provisions and preferences lightens the tax load of some only at the cost of placing a heavier burden on others. It distorts economic judgments and channels an undue amount of energy into efforts to avoid tax liabilities. It makes certain types of less productive activity more profitable than other more valuable undertakings. All this inhibits our growth and efficiency, as well as considerably complicating the work of both the taxpayer and the  Internal Revenue Service . These various exclusions and concessions have been justified in part as a means of overcoming oppressively high rates in the upper brackets--and a sharp reduction in those rates, accompanied by base-broadening, loophole-closing measures, would properly make the new rates not only lower but also more widely applicable.

"Our true choice is not between tax reduction, on the one hand, and the avoidance of large Federal deficits on the other. It is increasingly clear that no matter what party is in power, so long as our national security needs keep rising, an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenue to balance our budget just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits.  Surely the lesson of the last decade is that budget deficits are not caused by wild-eyed spenders but by slow economic growth and periodic  recessions , and any new recession would break all deficit records. In short,  it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now.  The experience of a number of  European  countries and  Japan  have borne this out. This country's own experience with tax reduction in 1954 has borne this out.  And the reason is that only  full employment  can balance the budget, and tax reduction can pave the way to that employment.

"Well,  the purpose of reform really is directed to the encouraging of growth and employment.  I quite agree that to launch into a full scale battle on general reform for academic reasons would be unwise.  The central purpose behind the reform must therefore be to encourage those changes in our tax laws which will encourage economic growth for that purpose, and not merely because it might have some longer range interest or significance. The primary job will be to encourage the flow of capital into those areas which stimulate the national growth and not diminish it. But it is going to be a tough fight, because once you spell out , as I said before,  reform, it's bound to affect adversely the interests of some, while favoring the interests of others.

"According to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library & Museum  President Kennedy got his facts wrong. Dante never made this statement. The closest to what President Kennedy meant is in the Inferno where the souls in the ante-room of hell, who ""lived without disgrace and without praise,"" and the coward angels, who did not rebel but did not resist the cohorts of Lucifer, are condemned to being whirled through the air by great winds while being stung by wasps and horseflies. Dante placed those who ""non furon ribelli né fur fedeli"" — were neither for nor against God, in a special region near the mouth of  Hell ; the lowest part of Hell, a lake of ice, was for traitors.  According to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library & Museum in the undated article ""John F. Kennedy's Favorite Quotations: Dante's Inferno""  President Kennedy's quote was based upon an interpretation of Dante's  Inferno . As  Robert Kennedy explained  in 1964, ""President Kennedy's favorite quote was really from Dante, 'The hottest places in  Hell  are reserved for those who in time of moral crisis preserve their neutrality.'"" This supposed quotation is not actually in Dante's work, but is based upon a similar one. In the  Inferno ,  Dante  and his guide  Virgil , on their way to Hell, pass by a group of dead souls outside the entrance to Hell. These individuals, when alive, remained neutral at a time of great moral decision. Virgil explains to Dante that these souls cannot enter either Heaven or Hell because they did not choose one side or another. They are therefore worse than the greatest sinners in Hell because they are repugnant to both God and Satan alike, and have been left to mourn their fate as insignificant beings neither hailed nor cursed in life or death, endlessly travailing below Heaven but outside of Hell. This scene occurs in the third canto of the  Inferno .  According to Bartleby.com  Kennedy's remark may have been inspired by the passage from Dante Alighieri's  La Comedia Divina  “Inferno,” canto 3, lines 35–42 (1972) passage as translated by Geoffrey L. Bickersteth: ""by those disbodied wretches who were loth when living, to be either blamed or praised. [...] Fear to lose beauty caused the heavens to expel these caitiffs; nor, lest to the damned they theng ave cause to boast, receives them the deep hell."" A more modern-sounding translation from the foregoing Dante's Inferno passage was translataed 1971 by Mark Musa thus: “They are mixed with that repulsive choir of angels … undecided in neutrality. Heaven, to keep its beauty, cast them out, but even Hell itself would not receive them for fear the wicked there might glory over them.",John F Kennedy,failure,Wikiquote – John F Kennedy,President,North America,1960s,male

This Nation is now engaged in a continuing debate about the rights of a portion of its citizens. This Nation is now engaged in a continuing debate about the rights of a portion of its citizens. That will go on, and those rights will expand until the standard first forged by the Nation's founders has been reached, and all Americans enjoy equal opportunity and liberty under law. But this Nation was not founded solely on the principle of citizens' rights. Equally important, though too often not discussed, is the citizen's responsibility. For  our privileges can be no greater than our obligations. The protection of our rights can endure no longer than the performance of our responsibilities. Each can be neglected only at the peril of the other. I speak to you today, therefore, not of your rights as Americans, but of your responsibilities. They are many in number and different in nature. They do not rest with equal weight upon the shoulders of all. Equality of opportunity does not mean equality of responsibility. All Americans must be responsible citizens, but some must be more responsible than others, by virtue of their public or their private position, their role in the family or community, their prospects for the future, or their legacy from the past.

You must decide, as  Goethe  put it, whether you will be an anvil or a hammer, whether you will give to the world in which you were reared and educated the broadest possible benefits of that education.  Of the many special obligations incumbent upon an educated citizen, I would cite three as outstanding: your obligation to the pursuit of learning, your obligation to serve the public, your obligation to uphold the law.",John F Kennedy,leadership,Wikiquote – John F Kennedy,President,North America,1960s,male
"If the pursuit of learning is not defended by the educated citizen, it will not be defended at all.  For there will always be those who scoff at intellectuals, who cry out against research, who seek to limit our educational system. Modern cynics and skeptics see no more reason for landing a man on the moon, which we shall do, than the cynics and skeptics of half a millennium ago saw for the discovery of this country. They see no harm in paying those to whom they entrust the minds of their children a smaller wage than is paid to those to whom they entrust the care of their plumbing.   But the educated citizen knows how much more there is to know. He knows that ""knowledge is power,"" more so today than ever before. He knows that  only an educated and informed people will be a free people , that  the ignorance of one voter in a democracy impairs the security of all , and that  if we can, as  Jefferson  put it, ""enlighten the people generally … tyranny and the oppressions of mind and body will vanish, like evil spirits at the dawn of day."" And, therefore, the educated citizen has a special obligation to encourage the pursuit of learning, to promote exploration of the unknown, to preserve the freedom of inquiry, to support the advancement of research, and to assist at every level of government the improvement of education for all Americans, from grade school to graduate school.",John F Kennedy,risk,Wikiquote – John F Kennedy,President,North America,1960s,male
"Secondly, the educated citizen has an obligation to serve the public. He may be a precinct worker or President. He may give his talents at the courthouse, the State house, the White House. He may be a civil servant or a Senator, a candidate or a campaign worker, a winner or a loser. But he must be a participant and not a spectator. ""At the  Olympic games ,""  Aristotle  wrote, ""it is not the finest and strongest men who are crowned, but they who enter the lists-for out of these the prize-men are elected.

"I would hope that all educated citizens would fulfill this obligation — in politics, in Government, here in Nashville, here in this State, in the  Peace Corps , in the Foreign Service, in the Government Service, in the Tennessee Valley, in the world.

"Third, and finally, the educated citizen has an obligation to uphold the law.  This is the obligation of every citizen in a free and peaceful society — but the educated citizen has a special responsibility by the virtue of his greater understanding.

He knows, too, that  every fellowman is entitled to be regarded with decency and treated with dignity.

I am talking about genuine peace, the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living, the kind that enables men and nations to grow and to hope and to build a better life for their children — not merely peace for Americans but peace for all men and women — not merely peace in our time but peace for all time.",John F Kennedy,leadership,Wikiquote – John F Kennedy,President,North America,1960s,male
"I speak of peace because of the new face of war. Total war makes no sense in an age when great powers can maintain large and relatively invulnerable nuclear forces and refuse to surrender without resort to those forces. It makes no sense in an age when a single nuclear weapon contains almost ten times the explosive force delivered by all the allied air forces in the  Second World War . It makes no sense in an age when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and water and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn.  Today the expenditure of billions of dollars every year on weapons acquired for the purpose of making sure we never need to use them is essential to keeping the peace. But surely the acquisition of such idle stockpiles — which can only destroy and never create — is not the only, much less the most efficient, means of assuring peace. I speak of peace , therefore,  as the necessary rational end of rational men. I realize that the pursuit of peace is not as dramatic as the pursuit of war — and frequently the words of the pursuer fall on deaf ears.

"Let us reexamine our attitude toward the cold war, remembering that we are not engaged in a debate, seeking to pile up debating points. We are not here distributing blame or pointing the finger of judgment.  We must deal with the world as it is, and not as it might have been had the history of the last 18 years been different.  We must, therefore, persevere in the search for peace in the hope that constructive changes within the Communist bloc might bring within reach solutions which now seem beyond us. We must conduct our affairs in such a way that it becomes in the Communists' interest to agree on a genuine peace. Above all, while defending our own vital interests,  nuclear powers must avert those confrontations which bring an adversary to a choice of either a humiliating retreat or a  nuclear war . To adopt that kind of course in the nuclear age would be evidence only of the bankruptcy of our policy — or of a collective death-wish for the world.  To secure these ends, America's weapons are nonprovocative, carefully controlled, designed to deter, and capable of selective use. Our military forces are committed to peace and disciplined in self- restraint. Our diplomats are instructed to avoid unnecessary irritants and purely rhetorical hostility. For  we can seek a relaxation of tension without relaxing our guard.  And, for our part,  we do not need to use threats to prove that we are resolute.

It would place the nuclear powers in a position to deal more effectively with one of the greatest hazards which man faces in 1963, the further spread of nuclear arms. It would increase our security — it would decrease the prospects of war.

"Finally, my fellow Americans,  let us examine our attitude toward peace and freedom here at home. The quality and spirit of our own society must justify and support our efforts abroad.  We must show it in the dedication of our own lives--as many of you who are graduating today will have a unique opportunity to do, by serving without pay in the Peace Corps abroad or in the proposed National Service Corps here at home. But  wherever we are, we must all, in our daily lives, live up to the age-old faith that peace and freedom walk together. In too many of our cities today, the peace is not secure because the freedom is incomplete. It is the responsibility of the executive branch at all levels of government--local, State, and National--to provide and protect that freedom for all of our citizens by all means within their authority. It is the responsibility of the legislative branch at all levels, wherever that authority is not now adequate, to make it adequate.

"This day devoted to the memory of Robert Frost offers an opportunity for reflection which is prized by politicians as well as by others, and even by poets, for  Robert Frost was one of the granite figures of our time in America. He was supremely two things: an artist and an American.  A nation reveals itself not only by the men it produces but also by the men it honors, the men it remembers. In America, our heroes have customarily run to men of large accomplishments. But today this college and country honors  a man whose contribution was not to our size but to our spirit, not to our political beliefs but to our insight, not to our self-esteem, but to our self- comprehension.  In honoring Robert Frost, we therefore can pay honor to  the deepest sources of our national strength. That strength takes many forms, and the most obvious forms are not always the most significant. The men who create power make an indispensable contribution to the Nation's greatness, but the men who question power make a contribution just as indispensable, especially when that questioning is disinterested, for they determine whether we use power or power uses us.",John F Kennedy,success,Wikiquote – John F Kennedy,President,North America,1960s,male
"Our national strength matters, but the spirit which informs and controls our strength matters just as much. This was the special significance of Robert Frost. He brought an unsparing instinct for reality to bear on the platitudes and pieties of society. His sense of the human tragedy fortified him against self-deception and easy consolation. ""I have been"" he wrote, ""one acquainted with the night."" And because he knew the midnight as well as the high noon, because he understood the ordeal as well as the triumph of the human spirit, he gave his age strength with which to overcome despair. At bottom, he held a deep faith in the spirit of man, and it is hardly an accident that Robert Frost coupled poetry and power, for he saw poetry as the means of saving power from itself.  When power leads men towards arrogance, poetry reminds him of his limitations. When power narrows the areas of man's concern, poetry reminds him of the richness and diversity of his existence. When power corrupts, poetry cleanses.

"The artist, however faithful to his personal vision of reality, becomes the last champion of the individual mind and sensibility against an intrusive society and an officious state. The great artist is thus a solitary figure.  He has, as  Frost  said, a lover's quarrel with the world. In pursuing his perceptions of reality, he must often sail against the currents of his time. This is not a popular role. If Robert Frost was much honored in his lifetime, it was because a good many preferred to ignore his darker truths. Yet in retrospect, we see how the artist's fidelity has strengthened the fiber of our national life. If sometimes our great artist have been the most critical of our society, it is because their sensitivity and their concern for justice, which must motivate any true artist, makes him aware that our Nation falls short of its highest potential.

For this Nation's strength and security are not easily or cheaply obtained, nor are they quickly and simply explained.  There are many kinds of strength and no one kind will suffice. Overwhelming nuclear strength cannot stop a guerrilla war. Formal pacts of alliance cannot stop internal subversion. Displays of material wealth cannot stop the disillusionment of diplomats subjected to discrimination. Above all, words alone are not enough.  The United States is a peaceful nation. And  where our strength and determination are clear, our words need merely to convey conviction, not belligerence. If we are strong, our strength will speak for itself. If we are weak, words will be of no help.",John F Kennedy,leadership,Wikiquote – John F Kennedy,President,North America,1960s,male
"In this administration also it has been necessary at times to issue specific warnings — warnings that  we could not stand by  and  watch the Communists conquer Laos by force , or  intervene in the Congo , or  swallow West Berlin , or  maintain offensive missiles on Cuba . But while our goals were at least temporarily obtained in these and other instances,  our successful defense of freedom was due not to the words we used, but to the strength we stood ready to use on behalf of the principles we stand ready to defend. This strength is composed of many different elements, ranging from the most massive deterrents to the most subtle influences. And all types of strength are needed — no one kind could do the job alone.",John F Kennedy,risk,Wikiquote – John F Kennedy,President,North America,1960s,male
"Our security and strength, in the last analysis, directly depend on the security and strength of others , and that is why our military and economic assistance plays such a key role in enabling those who live on the periphery of the Communist world to maintain their independence of choice. Our assistance to these nations can be painful, risky and costly, as is true in  Southeast Asia  today. But we dare not weary of the task.

"There is something wrong with our world, something fundamentally and basically wrong.  I don't think we have to look too far to see that. I'm sure that most of you would agree with me in making that assertion. And when we stop to analyze the cause of our world's ills, many things come to mind. We begin to wonder if it is due to the fact that we don't know enough. But it can't be that. Because in terms of accumulated knowledge we know more today than men have known in any period of human history. We have the facts at our disposal. We know more about  mathematics , about  science , about  social science , and  philosophy  than we've ever known in any period of the world's history. So it can't be because we don't know enough. And then we wonder if it is due to the fact that our scientific genius lags behind. That is, if we have not made enough progress scientifically. Well then, it can't be that. For our scientific progress over the past years has been amazing. Man through his scientific genius has been able to dwarf distance and place time in chains, so that today it's possible to eat breakfast in  New York City  and supper in  London ,  England . Back in about 1753 it took a letter three days to go from New York City to  Washington , and today you can go from here to  China  in less time than that. It can't be because man is stagnant in his scientific progress. Man's scientific genius has been amazing. I think we have to look much deeper than that if we are to find the real cause of man's problems and the real cause of the world's ills today. If we are to really find it I think we will have to look in the hearts and souls of men.",Martin Luther King Jr,risk,Wikiquote – Martin Luther King Jr,Civil Rights Leader,North America,1960s,male
"The trouble isn't so much that we don't know enough, but it's as if we aren't good enough.  The trouble isn't so much that our scientific genius lags behind, but our moral genius lags behind. The great problem facing modern man is that, that the means by which we live have outdistanced the spiritual ends for which we live.  So we find ourselves caught in a messed-up world. The problem is with man himself and man's soul. We haven't learned how to be just and honest and kind and true and loving. And that is the basis of our problem.  The real problem is that through our scientific genius we've made of the world a neighborhood, but through our moral and spiritual genius we've failed to make of it a brotherhood.  And the great danger facing us today is not so much the atomic bomb that was created by physical science. Not so much that atomic bomb that you can put in an  aeroplane  and drop on the heads of hundreds and thousands of people — as dangerous as that is. But the real danger confronting civilization today is that  atomic bomb  which lies in the hearts and souls of men, capable of exploding into the vilest of hate and into the most damaging selfishness — that's the atomic bomb that we've got to fear today. Problem is with the men. Within the heart and the souls of men.

"Sometimes, you know, it's necessary to go backward in order to go forward. That's an analogy of life. I remember the other day I was driving out of New York City into  Boston , and I stopped off in  Bridgeport ,  Connecticut , to visit some friends. And I went out of New York on a  highway  that's known as the  Merritt Parkway , it leads into Boston, a very fine parkway. And I stopped in Bridgeport, and after being there for two or three hours I decided to go on to Boston, and I wanted to get back on the Merritt Parkway. And I went out thinking that I was going toward the Merritt Parkway. I started out, and I rode, and I kept riding, and I looked up and I saw a sign saying two miles to a little town that I knew I was to bypass — I wasn't to pass through that particular town. So I thought I was on the wrong road. I stopped and I asked a gentleman on the road which way would I get to the Merritt Parkway. And he said, ""The Merritt Parkway is about twelve or fifteen miles back that way. You've got to turn around and go back to the Merritt Parkway; you are out of the way now."" In other words, before I could go forward to Boston, I had to go back about twelve or fifteen miles to get to the Merritt Parkway. May it not be that modern man has gotten on the wrong parkway? And if he is to go forward to the city of salvation, he's got to go back and get on the right parkway. [...] Now that's what we've got to do in our world today. We've left a lot of precious values behind; we've lost a lot of precious values. And if we are to go forward, if we are to make this a better world in which to live, we've got to go back.

"We have adopted in the modern world a sort of a  relativistic  ethic ... Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. It's wrong to  hate . It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in  America , it's wrong in  Germany , it's wrong in  Russia , it's wrong in  China . It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong. It's wrong to throw our lives away in riotous living. No matter if everybody in  Detroit  is doing it, it's wrong. It always will be wrong, and it always has been wrong. It's wrong in every age and it's wrong in every nation. Some things are right and some things are wrong, no matter if everybody is doing the contrary. Some things in this universe are absolute. The God of the universe has made it so.

"Now that isn't the only thing that convinces me that we've strayed away from this attitude, this principle. The other thing is that we have adopted a sort of a pragmatic test for right and wrong — whatever works is right. If it works, it's all right. Nothing is wrong but that which does not work. If you don't get caught, it's right. ... That's the attitude, isn't it? It's all right to disobey the  Ten Commandments , but just don't disobey the eleventh, ""Thou shall not get caught."" ... That's the attitude. That's the prevailing attitude in our culture. No matter what you do, just do it with a bit of finesse. You know, a sort of attitude of the survival of the slickest. Not the  Darwinian   survival of the fittest , but the survival of the slickest — whoever can be the slickest is the one who right. It's all right to lie, but lie with dignity. ... It's all right to steal and to rob and extort, but do it with a bit of finesse. It's even all right to hate, but just dress your hate up in the garments of love and make it appear that you are loving when you are actually hating. Just get by! That's the thing that's right according to this new ethic. My friends, that attitude is destroying the soul of our culture! It's destroying our nation!

It's not enough to know the intricacies of  zoology  and  biology , but we must know the intricacies of law. It is not enough to know that two and two makes four, but we've got to know somehow that it's right to be honest and just with our brothers. It's not enough to know all about our philosophical and mathematical disciplines, but we've got to know the simple disciplines of being honest and loving and just with all humanity.

And the world, even the church, is filled up with people who pay lip service to God and not life service. And there is always a danger that we will make it appear externally that we believe in God when internally we don't. We say with our mouths that we believe in him, but we live with our lives like he never existed. That is the ever-present danger confronting religion. That's a dangerous type of atheism.",Martin Luther King Jr,motivation,Wikiquote – Martin Luther King Jr,Civil Rights Leader,North America,1960s,male
"And I think, my friends, that that is the thing that has happened in America. That we have unconsciously left God behind. Now, we haven't consciously done it; we have unconsciously done it. You see, the text, you remember the text said that Jesus' parents went a whole day's journey not knowing that he wasn't with them. They didn't consciously leave him behind. It was unconscious; went a whole day and didn't even know it. It wasn't a conscious process. You see, we didn't grow up and say, ""Now, goodbye God, we're going to leave you now."" The  materialism  in America has been an unconscious thing. Since the rise of the  Industrial Revolution  in England, and then the invention of all of our gadgets and contrivances and all of the things and modern conveniences — we unconsciously left God behind. We didn't mean to do it. We just became so involved in getting our big bank accounts that we unconsciously forgot about God — we didn't mean to do it. We became so involved in getting our nice luxurious cars, and they're very nice, but we became so involved in it that it became much more convenient to ride out to the beach on Sunday afternoon than to come to church that morning. (Yes) It was an unconscious thing — we didn't mean to do it. We became so involved and fascinated by the intricacies of television that we found it a little more convenient to stay at home than to come to church. It was an unconscious thing — we didn't mean to do it. We didn't just go up and say, ""Now God, we're gone."" We had gone a whole day's journey and then we came to see that we had unconsciously ushered God out of the universe. A whole day's journey — didn't mean to do it. We just became so involved in things that we forgot about God. And that is the danger confronting us, my friends: that in a nation as ours where we stress  mass production , and that's mighty important, where we have so many conveniences and luxuries and all of that, there is the danger that we will unconsciously forget about God. I'm not saying that these things aren't important; we need them, we need cars, we need  money ; all of that's important to live. But whenever they become substitutes for God, they become injurious. And may I say to you this morning, that none of these things can ever be real substitutes for God.  Automobiles  and  subways ,  televisions  and  radios , dollars and cents can never be substitutes for God. For long before any of these came into existence, we needed God.

Not in the god that can give us a few televisions and radios, but the God who threw up that  great cosmic light  that gets up early in the morning in the eastern horizon, (who paints its technicolor across the blue — something that man could never make. I'm not going to put my ultimate faith in the little gods that can be destroyed in an atomic age, but the God who has been our help in ages past, and our hope for years to come, and our shelter in the time of storm, and our eternal home.

Few individuals learn this, and so they go through life merely existing and never living. Now you see signs all along in your everyday life with individuals who are the victims of self-centeredness. They are the people who live an eternal ""I."" They do not have the capacity to project the ""I"" into the ""Thou."" They do not have the mental equipment for an eternal, dangerous and sometimes costly  altruism . They live a life of perpetual  egotism . And they are the victims all around of the egocentric predicament.  They start out, the minute you talk with them, talking about what they can do, what they have done. They're the people who will tell you, before you talk with them five minutes, where they have been and who they know. They're the people who can tell you in a few seconds, how many degrees they have and where they went to school and how much money they have.  We meet these people every day.

"Now, we can say to a certain extent that persons in this situation are persons who have really never grown up. They are still children, at a point. For you see, a child is inevitably, necessarily egocentric. He is a bundle of his own sensations, clamoring to be cared for. And, to be sure, he has his own social context. He belongs to his mother, but he cares for her only because he wants to be fed and protected. He does not care for his mother for her sake but he cares for his mother for his own sake. And so a child is inevitably egocentric, inevitably self-centered. And that is why Dr. Burnham says that during the first six or seven years of  development , the ego is dominant within the  child . And both in  behavior  and in  attitudes , a child is a victim of self-centeredness. This is a part of the early development of a little child.

"I look at my little daughter every day and she wants certain things and when she wants them, she wants them.  And she almost cries out, ""I want what I want when I want it.""  She is not concerned about what I think about it or what Mrs. King thinks about it. She wants it. She's a child and that's very natural and normal for a child. She is inevitably self-centered because she's a child. But when one matures, when one rises above the early years of childhood, he begins to love people for their own sake. He turns himself to higher loyalties. He gives himself to something outside of himself. He gives himself to causes that he lives for and sometimes will even die for. He comes to the point that now he can rise above his individualistic concerns , and he understands then what Jesus meant when he says, ""He who finds his life shall lose it; he who loses his life for my sake, shall find it.""' In other words,  he who finds his ego shall lose his ego, but he who loseth his ego for my sake, shall find it. And so you see people who are apparently selfish; it isn't merely an ethical issue but it is a psychological issue. They are the victims of arrested development, and they are still children. They haven't grown up.  And like a modern novelist says about one of his characters, ""Edith is a little country, bounded on the east and the west, on the north and the south, by Edith.""

They are too absorbed in self and anything gets them off, anything makes them angry. Anything makes them feel that people are looking over them because of a tragic self-centeredness.

"I think one of the best ways to face this problem of self-centeredness is to discover some cause and some purpose, some loyalty outside of yourself and give yourself to that something. The best way to handle it is not to suppress the ego but to extend the ego into objectively meaningful channels.  And so many people are unhappy because they aren't doing anything. They're self-centered because they aren't doing anything. They haven't given themselves to anything and they just move around in their little circles.  One of the ways to rise above this self-centeredness is to move away from self and objectify yourself in something outside of yourself. Find some great cause and some great purpose, some loyalty to which you can give yourself and become so absorbed in that something that you give your life to it. Men and women have done this throughout all of the generations. And they have found that necessary ego satisfaction that life presents and that one desires through projecting self in something outside of self. As I said, you don't solve the problem by trying to trample over the ego altogether. That doesn't solve the problem. For you will always have the ego and the ego has certain desires, certain desires for significance.  The three great psychoanalysts of this age, of this century, pointed out that there are certain basic desires that human beings have and that they long for and that they seek at any cost. And so for  Freud  the basic desire was to be loved.  Jung  would say that the basic desire is to be secure. But then  Adler  comes along and says the basic desire of human nature is to feel important and a sense of significance. And I think of all of those, probably- certainly all are significant but the one that Adler mentions is probably even more significant than any: that  all human beings have a desire to belong and to feel significant and important. And the way to solve this problem is not to drown out the ego but to find your sense of importance in something outside of the self. And you are then able to live because you have given your life to something outside and something that is meaningful, objectified. You rise above this self-absorption to something outside. This is the way to go through life with a balance, with the proper perspective because you've given yourself to something greater than self. Sometimes it's friends, sometimes it's family, sometimes it's a great cause, it's a great loyalty, but give yourself to that something and life becomes meaningful.",Martin Luther King Jr,motivation,Wikiquote – Martin Luther King Jr,Civil Rights Leader,North America,1960s,male

O God, help me to give my self to my work and to my job and to my allegiance as this individual does."" And this is the way out. And I think this is what  [Ralph Waldo] Emerson  meant when he said: ""O, see how the masses of men worry themselves into nameless graves, while here and there, some great unselfish soul forgets himself into immortality.""

And you come to see that you're an adjective, not a noun. It is only God that is a noun, you are a dependent clause not an independent clause. You come to see through great religion, somehow, there is only one being in this universe that can say ""I am"" unconditionally.

"For a long time, man felt that he was the  center of the universe  and all of his  science  had given him that. All of the days in the past he came up under what was known as the  geocentric theory : the earth was the center of the universe and everything revolved around the earth. Then came  Copernicus  and  Galileo  and others, said that the sun is the center, the  heliocentric  theory came into being. And that reminded us somehow that we are dependent on something.  We are not just at the center of this universe. We are only at the center to the extent that we give ourselves and our allegiance to God Almighty.  And I'm so glad that the new science came into being to dampen our arrogance. It says to us that our earthly planet is a dependent planet; it is a small planet in the orbits of this universe. The sun is the center of this universe, that  man must look beyond himself to discover his significance.

But after looking at these things and admitting these things, we must  face  the  fact  that an individual might dislike us because of something that we've done deep down in the past, some personality attribute that we possess, something that we've done deep down in the past and we've forgotten about it; but it was that something that aroused the  hate  response within the  individual .

"The  Greek language  comes out with another word for love. It is the word  agape . ... agape is something of the  understanding , creative, redemptive goodwill for all men.  It is a love that seeks nothing in return. It is an overflowing love; it's what theologians would call the love of  God  working in the  lives  of men.  And when you rise to love on this level, you begin to love men, not because they are likeable, but because God loves them. You look at every man, and you love him because you know God loves him.  And he might be the worst person you've ever seen. And this is what  Jesus  means, I think, in this very passage when he says, ""Love your enemy."" And it's significant that he does not say, ""Like your enemy."" Like is a sentimental something, an affectionate something.  There are a lot of people that I find it difficult to like.  I don't like what they do to me. I don't like what they say about me and other people. I don't like their attitudes. I don't like some of the things they're doing. I don't like them. But  Jesus  says love them. And love is greater than like.  Love is  understanding , redemptive goodwill for all men, so that you love everybody, because  God  loves them. You refuse to do anything that will defeat an individual, because you have  agape  in your soul. And here you come to the point that you love the individual who does the evil deed, while hating the deed that the person does. This is what  Jesus  means when he says, ""Love your enemy.""

Somewhere somebody must have a little sense, and that's the strong person.  The  strong  person is the person who can cut off the chain of hate, the chain of evil.

"There's another reason why you should love your enemies, and that is because hate distorts the personality of the hater.  We usually think of what hate does for the individual hated or the individuals hated or the groups hated. But it is even more tragic, it is even more ruinous and injurious to the individual who hates. You just begin hating somebody, and you will begin to do irrational things. You can't see straight when you hate. You can't walk straight when you hate. You can't stand upright. Your vision is distorted. There is nothing more tragic than to see an individual whose heart is filled with hate. He comes to the point that he becomes a pathological case. For the person who hates, you can stand up and see a person and that person can be beautiful, and you will call them ugly. For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the true becomes false and the false becomes true. That's what hate does. You can't see right. The symbol of objectivity is lost.  Hate destroys the very structure of the personality of the hater.  [...]  when you start hating anybody, it destroys the very center of your creative response to life and the universe; so love everybody. Hate at any point is a cancer that gnaws away at the very vital center of your life and your existence. It is like eroding acid that eats away the best and the objective center of your life.

You just keep loving people and keep loving them, even though they're mistreating you. Here's the person who is a neighbor, and this person is doing something wrong to you and all of that. Just keep being friendly to that person. Keep loving them. Don't do anything to embarrass them. Just keep loving them, and they can't stand it too long. Oh, they react in many ways in the beginning. They react with bitterness because they're mad because you love them like that. They react with guilt feelings, and sometimes they'll hate you a little more at that transition period, but just keep loving them. And  by the power of your love they will break down under the load.

It is impossible even to begin the act of loving one's enemies without prior acceptance of the  necessity , over and over again, of forgiving those who inflict evil and injury upon us. It is also necessary to realize that the forgiving act must always be initiated by the person who has been wronged, the victim of some great hurt, the recipient of some tortuous injustice, the absorber of some terrible act of oppression.  The wrongdoer may request forgiveness. He may come to himself, and, like the prodigal son, move up with some dusty road, his heart palpitating with the desire for forgiveness. But only the injured neighbor, the loving father back home can really pour out the warm waters of forgiveness.",Martin Luther King Jr,success,Wikiquote – Martin Luther King Jr,Civil Rights Leader,North America,1960s,male
"Forgiveness  does not mean ignoring what has been done or putting a false label on an  evil  act. It means, rather, that the evil act no longer remains as a barrier to the relationship. Forgiveness is a catalyst creating the atmosphere necessary for a fresh start and a new  beginning . It is the lifting of a burden or the canceling of a debt.  The words ""I will forgive you, but never forget what you have done"" never explain the real nature of forgiveness.  Certainly one can never forget, if that means erasing totally for his mind. But when we forgive, we forget in the sense that the evil deed is no longer a mental block impeding a new relationship.  Likewise, we can never say, ""I will forgive you, but I won't have anything further to do with you.""  Forgiveness means reconciliation, a coming together again.

"Second we must recognize that the evil deed of the enemy-neighbor, the thing that hurts, never quite expresses all that he is. An element of goodness may be found even in our worst enemy. Each of us is something of a schizophrenic personality, tragically divided against ourselves.  A persistent civil war rages within all or our lives. Something within us causes us to lament with  Ovid , the Latin poet, ""I see and approve the better things, but follow the worse,"" or to agree with  Plato  that human  personality  is like a charioteer having two headstrong horses, each wanting to be go in a different direction, or to repeat with the  Apostle Paul , "" The good that I would I do not, but the evil which I would not, I do.",Martin Luther King Jr,success,Wikiquote – Martin Luther King Jr,Civil Rights Leader,North America,1960s,male

We see him in a new light.

"The meaning of  love  is not to be confused with some sentimental outpouring. Love is something much deeper that emotional bosh. Perhaps the Greek language can clear our confusion at this point.

The second word is philia, a reciprocal of love and the intimate affection and friendship between friends. We love those whom we like, and we love because we are loved. The third word is agape, understanding and creative, redemptive goodwill for all men. An overflowing love which seek nothing in return, agape is the love of God operating in the human  heart . At this level, we love men not because we like them, nor because they possess some type of divine spark; we love every man because God loves him. At this level, we love the person who does an evil deed, although we hate the deed that he does. [...] When Jesus bids us to love our enemies, he is speaking neither of eros nor philia; he is speaking of agape,  understanding and creative, redemptive goodwill toward men.

To accept passively an unjust system is to cooperate with that system; thereby the oppressed become as evil as the oppressor. Non-cooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good. The oppressed must never allow the conscience of the oppressor to slumber. Religion reminds every man that he is his brother's keeper. To accept injustice  or segregation passively  is to say to the oppressor that his actions are morally right. It is a way of allowing his conscience to fall asleep. At this moment the oppressed fails to be his brother's keeper. So acquiescence-while often the easier way-is not the moral way.

Violence as a way of achieving  racial  justice is both impractical and immoral. It is impractical because it is a descending spiral ending in destruction for all. The old law of an eye for an eye leaves everybody blind. It is immoral because it seeks to humiliate the opponent rather than win his understanding; it seeks to annihilate rather than to convert. Violence is immoral because it thrives on hatred rather than love. It destroys community and makes brotherhood impossible. It leaves society in monologue rather than dialogue. Violence ends by defeating itself. It creates bitterness in the survivors and brutality in the destroyers.,Martin Luther King Jr,leadership,Wikiquote – Martin Luther King Jr,Civil Rights Leader,North America,1960s,male
"The third way open to oppressed people in their quest for freedom is the way of nonviolent resistance.  Like the synthesis in  Hegelian philosophy ,  the principle of  nonviolent resistance  seeks to reconcile the truths of two opposites,  acquiescence  and  violence , while avoiding the extremes and immoralities of both. The nonviolent resister agrees with the person who acquiesces that one should not be physically aggressive toward his opponent; but he balances the equation by agreeing with the person of violence that evil must be resisted. He avoids the nonresistance of the former and the violent resistance of the latter.

One day when Moses confronted this problem, he wrote in the  book of Deuteronomy , the first chapter and the fifth verse:  ""You have been in this mountain long enough, turn ye and go on your journey, move on to the mount of the Amorite."" — This was a message of God through Moses.

"In every age and every generation men have envisioned some promised land.  Plato  envisioned it in his republic as a time when justice would reign throughout society and philosophers would become kings and kings philosophers.  Karl Marx  envisioned it as a classless society in which the proletariat would finally conquer the reign of the bourgeoisie; out of that idea came the slogan, ""from each according to his ability, to each according to his need.""  Bellamy , in  Looking Backward , thought of it as a day when the inequalities of monopoly capitalism would pass away. Society would exist on the basis of evenness of economic output.  Christianity  envisioned it as the  Kingdom of God , a time when the will of God will reign supreme, and brotherhood, love, and right relationships will be the order of society.  In every age and every generation men have dreamed of some promised land of fulfillment of freedom. Whether it was the right promised land or not, they dreamed of it. But in moving from some Egypt of slavery, whether in the intellectual, cultural or moral realm, toward some promised land, there is always the same temptation. Individuals will get bogged down in a particular mountain in a particular spot, and thereby become the victims of stagnant complacency.

Everybody is doing it, so it must be all right, and therefore we are caught in the clutches of conformity... In a sense, we are no longer concerned about the  ten commandments -they are not too important. Everybody is busy, as I have said so often, trying to obey the eleventh commandment: ""Thou shalt not get caught."" And so, according to this view, it is all right to lie with a bit of finesse. It's all right to exploit, but be a dignified exploiter. It's all right to even hate, but dress your hate up into garments of love and make it appear that you are loving when you are actually hating. This type of moral and ethical relativism is sapping the very life's blood of the moral and spiritual life of our nation and our world. And  I am convinced that if we are to be a great nation, and if we are to solve the problems of the world we must come out of this mountain. We have been in it too long.

"It seems to be a fact of life that human beings cannot continue to do wrong without eventually reaching out for some thin rationalization to clothe the obvious wrong in the beautiful garments of righteousness.

He says that the very interesting and unique thing about human nature is that man had the capacity temporarily to block the stream of consciousness and place anything in it that he wants to, and so we often end up justifying the rightness of the wrong. This is exactly what happened during the days of slavery. Even the Bible and religion were misused to crystallize the patterns of the status quo. And so it was argued from pulpits across the nation that the Negro was inferior by nature, because of  Noah 's curse upon the children of Ham. The apostle  Paul 's dictum became a watchword:  Servants , be obedient to your master. And then one brother had probably studied the logic of the great philosopher  Aristotle . You know Aristotle did a great deal to bring into being what we know as formal  logic , and he talked about the  syllogism , which had a major premise and a minor premise and a conclusion. And so this brother could put his argument in the framework of an Aristotelian syllogism. He could say, All men are made in the image of God.

It is a liberalism that is so objectively analytical that it fails to get subjectively committed. It is a liberalism that is neither hot nor cold but lukewarm. And we must come to see that his problem in the United States is not a sectional problem, but a national problem. No section of our country can boast of clean hands in the area of brotherhood. It is one thing for a white person of good will in the North to rise up with righteous indignation when a bus is burned in Anniston, Alabama, with freedom riders, or when a nasty mob assembles around a University of Mississippi, and even goes to the point of killing and injuring people to keep one Negro out of the university, or when a Negro is lynched or churches burned in the South; but that same person of good will must rise up with the same righteous indignation when a Negro in his state or in his city cannot live in a particular neighborhood because of the color of his skin, or cannot join a particular academic society or fraternal order or sorority because of the color of his or her skin, or cannot get a particular job in a particular firm because her happens to be a Negro.

Then even after working in these areas, he must understand that  a court order can only declare rights; it can never thoroughly deliver them.

"One of the great philosophical debates of the centuries has been over the whole question of ends and means.  There have been those individuals from  Machiavelli  on down who argued that the end justifies the means. Sometimes systems of government have followed this theory. Listen to  Lenin  as he says ""Lying, deceit, violence, concealing and withholding the truth are all justifiable means to bring about the end of the classless society.""  This is the great weakness and tragedy of communism and any other system that argues that the end justifies the means, for  in a real sense, the end is pre-existent in the means; the means represent the ideal in the making, and the end in process. In the long run of history, immoral means cannot bring about moral ends. Destructive means cannot bring about constructive goals. The beauty of non-violence is that is makes it possible for the individual to struggle to secure moral ends through moral means.  Another thing about it is that is makes it possible for the individual to apply the love-ethic in the struggle for freedom and justice. It makes it possible for the individual to place love at the center of his life, and thereby transform a social situation. This is the beauty of non-violence, because  hate is always injurious. It is as injurious to the hater as it is to the hated.  Psychiatrists are telling us now of many of the strange things that have happened in the subconscious. Many of the inner conflicts are rooted in hate, and so they are saying now, love or perish. And the beauty of non-violence is that it is possible to fight war without violence, and it is possible to struggle for that which is right with love in one's heart.",Martin Luther King Jr,success,Wikiquote – Martin Luther King Jr,Civil Rights Leader,North America,1960s,male

"Agape  is more than aesthetic or romantic love.  Agape  is more than friendship.  Agape  is creative, redemptive good for all men. It is an overflowing love which seeks nothing in return.  Theologians would say that it is the love of God operating in the human heart, and when one rises to love on this level, he loves every man, not because he likes that particular person, but because God loves him, and he rises to the level of loving the person who does the evil deed, while hating the deed that the person does. And I think that this is what  Jesus  meant when he said, ""Love your enemies,"" and I'm happy that he didn't say ""Like you enemies,"" because it's pretty difficult to like some people.  ""Like"" is affectionate, ""like"" is sentimental at points, and it's pretty difficult to like somebody bombing your home or threatening your children, or seeking to destroy you. It's pretty difficult to like them, but Jesus says, love them, and ""love"" is greater than ""like.""

I never intend to become adjusted to the madness of militarism, and maybe the great need of our nation and our world today is for a society of the creative maladjusted, men and women who will be as maladjusted as the prophet  Amos , who in the midst of the injustices of his day, could cry out in words that echo across the centuries, ""Let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream."" As maladjusted as  Abraham Lincoln , who had the vision to see that this nation could not exist half slave and half free. As maladjusted as  Thomas Jefferson , who in the midst of an age amazingly adjusted to slavery could cry out in words lifted to cosmic proportions, ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.

And  I believe that such maladjustment will help us emerge from the bleak and desolate midnight of man's inhumanity to man into the bright and glittering daybreak of freedom and justice. And then we will be able to go that additional distance, and we will speed up the day when all of God's children, white men and black men,  Jews  and  Gentiles ,  Protestants  and  Catholics , will be able to join hands right here in America and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, ""Free at last, free at last!

In any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps: collection of the  facts  to determine whether injustices exist;  negotiation ; self purification; and  direct action .,Martin Luther King Jr,leadership,Wikiquote – Martin Luther King Jr,Civil Rights Leader,North America,1960s,male
"You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit ins, marches and so forth? Isn't  negotiation  a better path?"" You are quite right in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a  community  which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent resister may sound rather shocking. But  I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for  growth .  Just as  Socrates  felt that it was  necessary  to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of  myths  and half truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in  society  that will help men rise from the dark depths of  prejudice  and  racism  to the majestic heights of  understanding  and  brotherhood .

"One may well ask: ""How can you advocate breaking some  laws  and obeying others?"" The answer lies in the fact that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws.  One has not only a legal, but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.  I would agree with  St. Augustine  that ""an unjust law is no law at all.",Martin Luther King Jr,leadership,Wikiquote – Martin Luther King Jr,Civil Rights Leader,North America,1960s,male
How does one determine whether a law is just or unjust? A just law is a man-made code that squares with the moral law or the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law. To put it in terms of St.  Thomas Aquinas : An unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law. Any law that uplifts the human  personality  is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority.,Martin Luther King Jr,failure,Wikiquote – Martin Luther King Jr,Civil Rights Leader,North America,1960s,male

"Five score years ago ,  a great American ,  in whose symbolic shadow we stand today , signed the  Emancipation Proclamation . This momentous decree came as a great beacon  light  of  hope  to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. But one hundred years later, we must face the tragic fact that the Negro is still not free.    One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity.

This note was a promise that all men, yes black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the inalienable rights of  life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness . It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked ""insufficient funds."" But  we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation.

Nonviolence has also meant that my people in the agonizing struggles of recent years have taken suffering upon themselves instead of inflicting it on others. It has meant, as I said, that we are no longer afraid and cowed. But in some substantial degree it has meant that we do not want to instill fear in others or into the society of which we are a part.

Many ships were lured upon the rocks, and men forgot home, duty, and honor as they flung themselves into the sea to be embraced by arms that drew them down to death. Ulysses, determined not to be lured by the Sirens, first decided to tie himself tightly to the mast of his boat, and his crew stuffed their ears with wax. But finally he and his crew learned a better way to save themselves: they took on board the beautiful singer Orpheus whose melodies were sweeter than the music of the Sirens.

A second group that abhorred the idea of going back to Egypt, and yet they abhorred the idea of facing the difficulties of moving ahead to the Promised Land and they somehow wanted to remain stationary and choose the line of least resistance.

This evening I want to deal mainly with the second group: those individuals that chose the line of least resistance, those individuals who didn't want to go back to Egypt but who did not quite have the strength to move on to the Promised Land. These are probably the people who wanted to remain stationary. These are the people who probably wanted to stop at a particular point and remain right there in the wilderness. God speaks through Moses to these people. The first chapter of the book of  Deuteronomy  said, ""Ye have been in this mountain long enough. Turn you and take your journey and go to the mount of the Amorites."" In other words, God was saying through Moses that  you must not allow yourself to get bogged down with unattained goals.

"Our whole campaign in Alabama has been centered around the right to vote. In focusing the attention of the nation and the world today on the flagrant denial of the right to vote, we are exposing the very origin, the root cause, of racial segregation in the Southland.  Racial segregation as a way of life did not come about as a natural result of hatred between the races immediately after the  Civil War . There were no laws segregating the races then. And as the noted historian,  C. Vann Woodward , in his book,  The Strange Career of Jim Crow,  clearly points out, the segregation of the races was really a political stratagem employed by the emerging Bourbon interests in the South to keep the southern masses divided and southern labor the cheapest in the land. You see, it was a simple thing to keep the poor white masses working for near-starvation wages in the years that followed the Civil War.  Why,  if the poor white plantation or mill worker became dissatisfied with his low wages, the plantation or mill owner would merely threaten to fire him and hire former Negro slaves and pay him even less. Thus, the southern wage level was kept almost unbearably low. Toward the end of the  Reconstruction era , something very significant happened. That is what was known as the Populist Movement. The leaders of this movement began awakening the poor white masses and the former Negro slaves to the fact that they were being fleeced by the emerging Bourbon interests. Not only that, but they began uniting the Negro and white masses into a voting bloc that threatened to drive the Bourbon interests from the command posts of political power in the South. To meet this threat, the southern aristocracy began immediately to engineer this development of a segregated society.  I want you to follow me through here because this is very important to see the roots of racism and the denial of the right to vote.  Through their control of mass media, they revised the doctrine of white supremacy. They saturated the thinking of the poor white masses with it, thus clouding their minds to the real issue involved in the Populist Movement. They then directed the placement on the books of the South of laws that made it a crime for Negroes and whites to come together as equals at any level. And that did it. That crippled and eventually destroyed the Populist Movement of the nineteenth century.",Martin Luther King Jr,leadership,Wikiquote – Martin Luther King Jr,Civil Rights Leader,North America,1960s,male
"If it may be said of the slavery era that the white man took the world and gave the Negro Jesus, then it may be said of the Reconstruction era that the southern aristocracy took the world and gave the poor white man  Jim Crow . He gave him Jim Crow. And when his wrinkled stomach cried out for the food that his empty pockets could not provide, he ate Jim Crow, a psychological bird that told him that no matter how bad off he was, at least he was a white man, better than the black man.  And he ate Jim Crow. And when his undernourished children cried out for the necessities that his low wages could not provide, he showed them the Jim Crow signs on the buses and in the stores, on the streets and in the public buildings. And his children, too, learned to feed upon Jim Crow, their last outpost of psychological oblivion.  Thus, the threat of the free exercise of the ballot by the Negro and the white masses alike resulted in the establishment of a segregated society.  They segregated southern money from the poor whites; they segregated southern mores from the rich whites; they segregated southern churches from Christianity; they segregated southern minds from honest thinking; and they segregated the Negro from everything.  That's what happened when the Negro and white masses of the South threatened to unite and build a great society: a society of justice where none would pray upon the weakness of others; a society of plenty where greed and poverty would be done away; a society of brotherhood where every man would respect the dignity and worth of human personality.",Martin Luther King Jr,leadership,Wikiquote – Martin Luther King Jr,Civil Rights Leader,North America,1960s,male

"Now there is another problem facing us that we must deal with if we are to remain awake through a social revolution. We must get rid of violence, hatred, and war.  Anyone who feels that the problems of mankind can be solved through violence is sleeping through a revolution.  I've said this over and over again, and I believe it more than ever today. We know about violence. It's been the inseparable twin of Western materialism, the hallmark of its grandeur.  I am convinced that violence ends up creating many more social problems than it solves.  This is why I say to my people that if we succumb to the temptation of using violence in our struggle, unborn generations will be the recipients of a long and desolate night of bitterness. There is another way — a way as old as the insights of  Jesus  of Nazareth and as modern as the techniques of  Mohandas K. Gandhi . For it is possible to stand up against an unjust system with all of your might, with all of your body, with all of your soul, and yet not stoop to hatred and violence. Something about this approach disarms the opponent. It exposes his moral defenses, weakens his morale, and at the same time, works on his conscience. He doesn't know how to handle it. So it is my great hope that, as we struggle for racial justice, we will follow that philosophy and method of non-violent resistance, realizing that this is the approach that can bring about that better day of racial justice for everyone.  In international relations, we must come to see this.  We must find some alternative to war and bloodshed.  In a day when man-made vehicles are dashing through outer space, and guided ballistic missiles are carving highways of death in the stratosphere, no nation can win a world war.  It is no longer a choice between violence and non-violence; it is either non-violence or non-existence.

"It is easier for a Negro to understand a social paradox because he has lived so long with evils that could be eradicated but were perpetuated by indifference or ignorance. The Negro finally had to devise unique methods to deal with his problem, and perhaps the measure of success he is realizing can be an inspiration to others coping with tenacious social problems.  In our struggle for equality we were confronted with the reality that many millions of people were essentially ignorant of our conditions or refused to face unpleasant truths. The hard-core bigot was merely one of our adversaries.

We knew that there were solutions and that the majority of the nation were ready for them. Yet we also knew that the existence of solutions would not automatically operate to alter conditions.

"There is a striking kinship between our movement and  Margaret Sanger 's early efforts. She, like we, saw the horrifying conditions of ghetto life. Like we, she knew that all of society is poisoned by cancerous slums. Like we, she was a direct actionist — a nonviolent resister. She was willing to accept scorn and abuse until the truth she saw was revealed to the millions. At the turn of the century she went into the slums and set up a birth control clinic, and for this deed she went to jail because she was violating an unjust law. Yet the years have justified her actions. She launched a movement which is obeying a higher law to preserve human life under humane conditions. Margaret Sanger had to commit what was then called a crime in order to enrich humanity, and today we honor her courage and vision; for without them there would have been no beginning. Our sure beginning in the struggle for equality by nonviolent direct action may not have been so resolute without the tradition established by  Margaret Sanger  and people like her.

"During the past half century Negroes have migrated on a massive scale, transplanting millions from rural communities to crammed urban ghettoes. In their migration, as with all migrants, they carried with them the folkways of the countryside into an inhospitable city slum. The size of family that may have been appropriate and tolerable on a manually cultivated farm was carried over to the jammed streets of the ghetto.  In all respects Negroes were atomized, neglected and discriminated against. Yet, the worst omission was the absence of institutions to acclimate them to their new environment.  Margaret Sanger, who offered an important institutional remedy, was unfortunately ignored by social and political leaders in this period. In consequence, Negro folkways in family size persisted.  The problem was compounded when unrestrained exploitation and discrimination accented the bewilderment of the newcomer, and high rates of illegitimacy and fragile family relationships resulted.",Martin Luther King Jr,success,Wikiquote – Martin Luther King Jr,Civil Rights Leader,North America,1960s,male

This is not to suggest that the Negro will solve all his problems through  Planned Parenthood .

"When the church is true to its guidelines, it sets out to preach deliverance to them that are captive. This is the role of the church: to free people. This merely means to free those who are slaves. Now if you notice some churches, they never read this part. Some churches aren't concerned about freeing anybody. Some white churches face the fact Sunday after Sunday that their members are slaves to prejudice, slaves to fear. You got a third of them, or a half of them or more, slaves to their prejudices. And the preacher does nothing to free them from their prejudice so often. Then you have another group sitting up there who would really like to do something about racial injustice, but they are afraid of social, political, and economic reprisals, so they end up silent. And the preacher never says anything to lift their souls and free them from that fear. And so they end up captive. You know this often happens in the Negro church. You know, there are some Negro preachers that have never opened their mouths about the freedom movement. And not only have they not opened their mouths, they haven't done anything about it. And every now and then you get a few members:  ""They talk too much about civil rights in that church.""  I was talking with a preacher the other day and he said a few of his members were saying that. I said,  ""Don't pay any attention to them. Because number one, the members didn't anoint you to preach. And any preacher who allows members to tell him what to preach isn't much of a preacher."" For the guidelines made it very clear that God anointed. No member of  Ebenezer Baptist Church  called me to the ministry.  You called me to Ebenezer, and you may turn me out of here, but you can't turn me out of the ministry, because I got my guidelines and my anointment from God Almighty. And anything I want to say, I'm going to say it from this pulpit. It may hurt somebody, I don't know about that; somebody may not agree with it. But when God speaks, who can but prophesy? The word of God is upon me like fire shut up in my bones, and when God's word gets upon me, I've got to say it, I've got to tell it all over everywhere. And God has called me to deliver those that are in captivity.   Some people are suffering. Some people are hungry this morning. Some people are still living with segregation and discrimination this morning. I'm going to preach about it. I'm going to fight for them. I'll die for them if necessary, because I got my guidelines clear. And the God that I serve and the God that called me to preach told me that every now and then I'll have to go to jail for them. Every now and then I'll have to agonize and suffer for the freedom of his children. I even may have to die for it. But if that's necessary, I'd rather follow the guidelines of God than to follow the guidelines of men.

Do you realize that the  Vietnamese people proclaimed their own independence in 1945 , after a combined French and Japanese occupation. And incidentally, this was before the  communist revolution in China . They were led by  Ho Chi Minh . And this is a little known fact, these people declared themselves independent in 1945, they quoted  our   Declaration of Independence  in their document of freedom. And yet our government refused to recognize, President  Truman  said they were not ready for independence. So we failed victim as a nation at that time of the same deadly arrogance that has poisoned the international situation for all of these years. France then set out to reconquer its former colony. And they fought eight long, hard, brutal years, trying to reconquer Vietnam. You know who helped France? It was the United States of America, it came to the point that we were meeting more than 80% of the war cost. And even when France started despairing of its reckless action, we did not. And  in 1954, a conference was called at Geneva , and an agreement was reached, because France had been defeated at  Dien Bien Phu . But even after that and even after the Geneva Accord, we did not stop. We must face the sad fact that our government sought in a real sense to sabotage the Geneva Accord. Well, after the French were defeated, it looked as if independence and land reform would come through the Geneva agreement. But instead the United States came and started supporting a man named  Diem , who turned out to be one of the most ruthless dictators in the history of the world. He set out to silence all opposition, people were brutally murdered merely because they raised their voices against the brutal policies of Diem. And the peasants watched and cringed as Diem ruthlessly rooted out all opposition. The peasants watched as all this was presided over by United States influence, and then by increasing numbers of United States troops, who came to help quell the insurgency that Diem's methods had aroused. When Diem was overthrown they may have been happy, but the long line of military dictatorships seemed to offer no real change, especially in terms of their need for land and peace.

It's a man by the name of General  Ky , who fought with the French against his own people, and who said on one occasion that the greatest hero of his life is  Hitler .

Our only hope today lies in our ability to recapture the  revolutionary  spirit and go out into a sometimes hostile world declaring eternal hostility to poverty, racism, and militarism.  With this powerful commitment we shall boldly challenge the status quo, we shall boldly challenge unjust mores, and thereby speed up the day when ""every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the rough places shall be made plain, and the crooked places straight.

"A genuine revolution of values means in the final analysis that our loyalties must become ecumenical rather than sectional.  Every nation must now develop an overriding loyalty to mankind as a whole in order to preserve the best in their individual societies. This call for a worldwide fellowship that lifts neighborly concern beyond one's tribe, race, class, and nation is in reality a call for an all-embracing, unconditional love for all men.  This oft misunderstood and misinterpreted concept, so readily dismissed by the  Nietzsches  of the world as a weak and cowardly force, has now become an absolute necessity for the survival of mankind. And  when I speak of love I'm not speaking of some sentimental and weak response. I am speaking of that force which all of the great religions have seen as the supreme unifying principle of life. Love is somehow the key that unlocks the door which leads to ultimate reality.  This  Hindu - Muslim - Christian - Jewish - Buddhist  belief about ultimate reality is beautifully summed up in the  first epistle of John  ""Let us love one another, for God is love.

Of the good things in life, the Negro has approximately one half those of whites. of the bad things of life, he has twice those of whites. Thus half of all Negroes live in substandard housing. And Negroes have half the income of whites. When we view the negative experiences of life, the Negro has a double share. There are twice as many unemployed.

And, with a spirit straining toward true self-esteem, the Negro must boldly throw off the manacles of self-abegnation and say to himself and to the world, ""I am somebody. I am a person. I am a man with dignity and honor. I have a rich and noble history, however painful and exploited that history has been. Yes, I was a slave through my foreparents, and now I'm not ashamed of that.

"Power properly understood is nothing but the ability to achieve purpose. It is the strength required to bring about social, political and economic change. ... Now a lot of us are preachers, and all of us have our moral convictions and concerns, and so often have problems with power. There is nothing wrong with power if power is used correctly.  You see, what happened is that some of our philosophers got off base. And one of the great problems of history is that the concepts of love and power have usually been contrasted as opposites — polar opposites — so that love is identified with a resignation of power, and power with a denial of love.   It was this misinterpretation that caused  Nietzsche , who was a philosopher of the will to power, to reject the Christian concept of love. It was this same misinterpretation which induced Christian theologians to reject the Nietzschean philosophy of the will to power in the name of the Christian idea of love. Now, we've got to get this thing right.  What is needed is a realization that power without love is reckless and abusive, and love without power is sentimental and anemic. Power at its best is love implementing the demands of justice, and justice at its best is power correcting everything that stands against love.  And this is what we must see as we move on. What has happened is that we have had it wrong and confused in our own country, and this has led Negro Americans in the past to seek their goals through power devoid of love and conscience.   This is leading a few extremists today to advocate for Negroes the same destructive and conscienceless power that they have justly abhorred in whites.

Yesterday, I tried to analyze the riots and deal with their causes. Today I want to give the other side. There is certainly something painfully sad about a riot. One sees screaming youngsters and angry adults fighting hopelessly and aimlessly against impossible odds. And deep down within them, you can see a desire for self-destruction, a kind of suicidal longing.   Occasionally Negroes contend that the 1965 Watts riot and the other riots in various cities represented effective civil rights action. But those who express this view always end up with stumbling words when asked what concrete gains have been won as a result. At best, the riots have produced a little additional anti-poverty money allotted by frightened government officials and a few water sprinklers to cool the children of the ghettos.

And then if you can't even say that, sometimes you may have to say, ""He's my everything. He's my sister and my brother. He's my mother and my father."" If you believe it and know it, you never need walk in darkness. Don't be a fool. Recognize your dependence on God. As the days become dark and the nights become dreary, realize that there is a God who rules above. And so I'm not worried about tomorrow. I get weary every now and then.

I want to move to the point of saying that if this instinct is not harnessed, it becomes a very dangerous, pernicious instinct. For instance, if it isn't harnessed, it causes one's personality to become distorted. I guess that's the most damaging aspect of it: what it does to the personality. If it isn't harnessed, you will end up day in and day out trying to deal with your ego problem by boasting.  Have you ever heard  people  that — you know, and I'm sure you've met them — that really  become sickening because they just sit up all the time talking about themselves. And they just boast and boast and boast, and that's the person who has not harnessed the drum major instinct. And then it does other things to the personality. It causes you to lie about who you know sometimes. There are some people who are influence peddlers. And in their attempt to deal with the drum major instinct, they have to try to identify with the so-called big-name people.

When ninety thousand years had come to an end, I saw Abu Yazid, and all that I saw, all was I. Then I traversed four thousand wildernesses, and reached the end. When I gazed, I saw myself at the beginning of the degree of the prophets. Then for such a while I went on in that infinity, that I said, “No one has ever reached higher than this. Loftier than this no station can be.” When I looked well, I saw that my head was at the sole of the foot of a prophet. Then I realized that the end of the state of the  saints  is but the beginning of the states of the prophets; to the end of the prophets there is no term. Then my spirit transcended the whole Dominion, and Heaven and Hell were displayed to it; but it heeded naught Whatever came before it, that it could not suffer. To the soul of no prophet it reached, without it gave greeting.  When it reached the soul of God's Chosen One, upon him be peace, there it beheld a hundred thousand seas of fire without end, and a thousand veils of light. Had I so much as dipped my foot in the first of those seas, I would have been consumed and given myself over to destruction. Therefore I became so bewildered with awe and confusion, that naught remained of me. However I desired to be able to see but the tent-peg of the pavilion of Mohammad, God's Messenger, I had not the boldness. Though I had attained to God, I had not the boldness to attain to Mohammad. Then Abu Yazid said, “O God, whatsoever thing I have seen, all has been I. There is no way for me to Thee, so long as this ‘I’ remains; there is no transcending my selfhood for me What must I do?” The command came, “To be delivered out of thy thouness, follow after Our beloved, the Arab Mohammad. Anoint thine eye with the dust of his foot, and continue following after him.",Muhammad,motivation,Wikiquote – Muhammad,Religious Leader,Middle East,600s,male

"The  way  to  God  is  exceedingly  fearful  and blocked deep by snow. Mohammed risked his life, driving  his  horse  through  and  opening  up  the road. Whoever goes on this road, does so by his guidance and guarding.

If you go that way you  will  perish,  even  as  the  people  of  ‘Ad  and Thamud,  but  if  you  go  in  this  direction  you  will be  saved,  like  the  believers... Know that Mohammed is the guide. God says,“Until you first come to Mohammed you cannot reach  Us.”  This  is  like  when  you  decide  to  go somewhere; thought leads the way, saying, “Go to this place, it is in your best interests.” After that your  eyes  act  as  a  guide,  and  then  your  limbs begin  to  move,  all  in  that  order.

"They show as little Reason as Conscience who put the matter by with saying—""Men, in some cases, are lawfully made Slaves, and why may not these?"" So men, in some cases, are lawfully put to death, deprived of their goods, without their consent; may any man, therefore, be treated so, without any conviction of desert?

"Passing from quantity to quality of population, we come to the question of  eugenics . We may perhaps assume that, if people grow less superstitious, government will acquire the right to sterilize those who are not considered desirable as parents. This power will be used, at first, to diminish imbecility, a most desirable object.  But probably, in time, opposition to the government will be taken to prove imbecility, so that rebels of all kinds will be sterilized. Epileptics, consumptives, dipsomaniacs and so on will gradually be included; in the end, there will be a tendency to include all who fail to pass the usual school examinations. The result will be to increase the average intelligence; in the long run, it may be greatly increased. But probably the effect upon really exceptional intelligence will be bad. Mr. Micawber, who was Dickens's father, would hardly have been regarded as a desirable parent.

"Eugenics has, of course, more ambitious possibilities in a more distant future. It may aim not only at eliminating undesired types, but at increasing desired types. Moral standards may alter so as to make it possible for one man to be the sire of a vast progeny by many different mothers. When men of science envisage a possibility of this kind, they are  prone to a type of fallacy which is common also in other directions. They imagine that a reform inaugurated by men of science would be administered as men of science would wish, by men similar in outlook to those who have advocated it. In like manner women who advocated votes for women used to imagine that the woman voter of the future would resemble the ardent feminist who won her the vote; and socialist leaders imagine that a socialist State would be administered by idealistic reformers like themselves. These are, of course, delusions; a reform, once achieved, is handed over to the average citizen. So, if eugenics reached the point where it could increase desired types, it would not be the types desired by present-day eugenists that would be increased, but rather the type desired by the average official. Prime Ministers, Bishops, and others whom the State considers desirable might become the fathers of half the next generation. Whether this would be an improvement it is not for me to say, as I have no hope of ever becoming either a Bishop or a Prime Minister.",Bertrand Russell,leadership,Wikiquote – Bertrand Russell,Philosopher,Europe,1950s,male

Optimism and pessimism, as cosmic philosophies, show the same naive humanism; the great world, so far as we know it from the philosophy of nature, is neither good nor bad, and is not concerned to make us happy or unhappy.

"When, in youth, I learned what was called ""philosophy"" ... no one ever mentioned to me the question of ""meaning."" Later, I became acquainted with  Lady Welby 's work on the subject, but failed to take it seriously. I imagined that logic could be pursued by taking it for granted that symbols were always, so to speak, transparent, and in no way distorted the objects they were supposed to ""mean."" Purely logical problems have gradually led me further and further from this point of view. Beginning with the question whether the class of all those classes which are not members of themselves is, or is not, a member of itself; continuing with the problem whether the man who says ""I am lying"" is lying or speaking the truth; passing through the riddle ""is the present King of France bald or not bald, or is the law of excluded middle false?"" I have now come to believe that the order of words in time or space is an ineradicable part of much of their significance – in fact, that the reason they can express space-time occurrences is that they are space-time occurrences, so that a logic independent of the accidental nature of spacetime becomes an idle dream. These conclusions are unpleasant to my vanity, but pleasant to my love of philosophical activity: until vitality fails, there is no reason to be wedded to one's past theories. (p. 114)",Bertrand Russell,risk,Wikiquote – Bertrand Russell,Philosopher,Europe,1950s,male
"[Messrs Ogden and Richards] will reply that they are considering the meaning of a ""thought,"" not of a word. A ""thought"" is not a social phenomenon, like speech, and therefore does not have the two sides, active and passive, which can be distinguished in speech. I should urge, however, that all the reasons which led our authors to avoid introducing images in explaining meaning should have also led them to avoid introducing ""thoughts."" If a theory of meaning is to be fitted into natural science as they desire, it is necessary to define the meaning of  words  without introducing anything ""mental"" in the sense in which what is ""mental"" is not subject to the laws of physics. Therefore, for the same reasons for which I now hold that the meaning of words should be explained without introducing images – which I argued to be possible in the above-quoted passage – I also hold that meaning in general should be treated without introducing ""thoughts,"" and should be regarded as a property of words considered as physical phenomena. Let us therefore amend their theory. They say: ""'I am thinking of A' is the same thing as 'My thought is being caused by A.'"" Let us substitute: ""'I am speaking of A' is the same thing as 'My speech is being caused by A.'""

"Mankind , ever since there have been  civilized  communities have been confronted with  problems  of two different kinds. On the one hand there has been the problem of mastering  natural   forces , of acquiring the  knowledge  and the  skill  required to produce tools and weapons and to encourage Nature in the production of useful animals and plants. This problem, in the modern world, is dealt with by  science  and scientific technique, and experience has shown that in order to deal with it adequately it is necessary to train a large number of rather narrow specialists.   But there is a second problem, less precise, and by some mistakenly regarded as unimportant – I mean the problem of how best to utilize our command over the forces of nature. This includes such burning issues as  democracy  versus  dictatorship ,  capitalism  versus  socialism , international  government  versus international  anarchy ,  free   speculation  versus  authoritarian   dogma . On such issues the laboratory can give no decisive guidance.  The kind of knowledge that gives most  help  in solving such problems is a wide survey of  human   life , in the  past  as well as in the  present , and an appreciation of the sources of misery or contentment as they appear in  history .",Bertrand Russell,failure,Wikiquote – Bertrand Russell,Philosopher,Europe,1950s,male
"There are a number of purely theoretical questions, of perennial and passionate interest, which science is unable to answer, at any rate at present.  Do we survive  death  in any sense, and if so, do we survive for a  time  or for ever? Can  mind  dominate  matter , or does matter completely dominate mind, or has each, perhaps, a certain limited independence? Has the  universe  a  purpose ? Or is it driven by blind  necessity ? Or is it a mere  chaos  and jumble, in which the natural laws that we think we find are only a phantasy generated by our own  love  of  order ? If there is a  cosmic  scheme, has life more importance in it than  astronomy  would lead us to suppose, or is our emphasis upon life mere parochialism and self-importance?  I do not know the answer to these questions, and I do not believe that anybody else does, but I think human life would be impoverished if they were forgotten, or if definite answers were accepted without adequate  evidence . To keep alive the interest in such questions, and to scrutinize suggested answers, is one of the functions of  philosophy .",Bertrand Russell,success,Wikiquote – Bertrand Russell,Philosopher,Europe,1950s,male
"The demand for certainty is one which is natural to man, but is nevertheless an intellectual vice.  If you take your children for a picnic on a doubtful day, they will demand a dogmatic answer as to whether it will be fine or wet, and be disappointed in you when you cannot be sure. The same sort of assurance is demanded, in later life, of those who undertake to lead populations into the Promised Land. ""Liquidate the capitalists and the survivors will enjoy eternal bliss."" ""Exterminate the Jews and everyone will be virtuous."" ""Kill the Croats and let the Serbs reign."" ""Kill the Serbs and let the Croats reign."" These are samples of the slogans that have won wide popular acceptance in our time. Even a modicum of philosophy would make it impossible to accept such bloodthirsty nonsense.  But so long as men are not trained to withhold judgment in the absence of evidence, they will be led astray by cocksure prophets, and it is likely that their leaders will be either ignorant fanatics or dishonest charlatans. To endure uncertainty is difficult, but so are most of the other virtues.  For the learning of every virtue there is an appropriate discipline, and for the learning of suspended judgment the best discipline is philosophy.    But if philosophy is to serve a positive purpose, it must not teach mere skepticism, for, while the dogmatist is harmful, the skeptic is useless. Dogmatism and skepticism are both, in a sense, absolute philosophies; one is certain of knowing, the other of not knowing. What philosophy should dissipate is certainty, whether of knowledge or of ignorance.",Bertrand Russell,failure,Wikiquote – Bertrand Russell,Philosopher,Europe,1950s,male
"Knowledge is not so precise a concept as is commonly thought.  Instead of saying ""I know this,"" we ought to say ""I more or less know something more or less like this."" It is true that this proviso is hardly necessary as regards the multiplication table, but knowledge in practical affairs has not the certainty or the precision of arithmetic. Suppose I say ""democracy is a good thing"": I must admit, first, that I am less sure of this than I am that two and two are four, and secondly, that ""democracy"" is a somewhat vague term which I cannot define precisely. We ought to say, therefore: ""I am fairly certain that it is a good thing if a government has something of the characteristics that are common to the British and American Constitutions,"" or something of this sort. And one of the aims of education ought to be to make such a statement more effective from a platform than the usual type of political slogan.",Bertrand Russell,leadership,Wikiquote – Bertrand Russell,Philosopher,Europe,1950s,male
"The pursuit of philosophy is founded on the belief that knowledge is good, even if what is known is painful.  A man imbued with the philosophic spirit, whether a professional philosopher or not, will wish his beliefs to be as true as he can make them, and will, in equal measure, love to know and hate to be in error. This principle has a wider scope than may be apparent at first sight.",Bertrand Russell,success,Wikiquote – Bertrand Russell,Philosopher,Europe,1950s,male
"It is not to be supposed that young men and women who are busy acquiring valuable specialized knowledge can spare a great deal of time for the study of philosophy, but even in the time that can easily be spared without injury to the learning of technical skills, philosophy can give certain things that will greatly increase the student's value as a human being and as a citizen. It can give a habit of exact and careful thought, not only in mathematics and science, but in questions of large practical import. It can give an impersonal breadth and scope to the conception of the ends of life. It can give to the individual a just measure of himself in relation to society, of man in the present to man in the past and in the future, and of the whole history of man in relation to the astronomical cosmos. By enlarging the objects of his thoughts it supplies an antidote to the anxieties and anguish of the present, and makes possible the nearest approach to  serenity  that is available to a sensitive mind in our tortured and uncertain world.",Bertrand Russell,leadership,Wikiquote – Bertrand Russell,Philosopher,Europe,1950s,male

Vanity is a motive of immense potency. Anyone who has much to do with children knows how they are constantly performing some antic, and saying ""Look at me.""  ""Look at me"" is one of the most fundamental desires of the human heart.  It can take innumerable forms, from buffoonery to the pursuit of posthumous fame.",Bertrand Russell,success,Wikiquote – Bertrand Russell,Philosopher,Europe,1950s,male
"One of the troubles about vanity is that it grows with what it feeds on. The more you are talked about, the more you will wish to be talked about. The condemned murderer who is allowed to see the account of his trial in the press is indignant if he finds a newspaper which has reported it inadequately. And the more he finds about himself in other newspapers, the more indignant he will be with the one whose reports are meagre. Politicians and literary men are in the same case... It is scarcely possible to exaggerate the influence of vanity throughout the range of human life, from the child of three to the potentate at whose frown the world trembles. Mankind have even committed the impiety of attributing similar desires to the Deity, whom they imagine avid for continual praise.   But great as is the influence of the motives we have been considering, there is one which outweighs them all. I mean the love of power. Love of power is closely akin to vanity, but it is not by any means the same thing. What vanity needs for its satisfaction is glory, and it is easy to have glory without power. The people who enjoy the greatest glory in the United States are film stars, but they can be put in their place by the Committee for Un-American Activities, which enjoys no glory whatever.",Bertrand Russell,success,Wikiquote – Bertrand Russell,Philosopher,Europe,1950s,male
"Power, like vanity, is insatiable. Nothing short of omnipotence could satisfy it completely. And as it is especially the vice of energetic men, the causal efficacy of love of power is out of all proportion to its frequency. It is, indeed, by far the strongest motive in the lives of important men.   Love of power is greatly increased by the experience of power, and this applies to petty power as well as to that of potentates.",Bertrand Russell,leadership,Wikiquote – Bertrand Russell,Philosopher,Europe,1950s,male
"The pursuit of  knowledge  is, I think, mainly actuated by love of power. And so are all advances in scientific technique. In politics, also, a reformer may have just as strong a love of power as a despot. It would be a complete mistake to decry love of power altogether as a motive. Whether you will be led by this motive to actions which are useful, or to actions which are pernicious, depends upon the social system, and upon your capacities.",Bertrand Russell,success,Wikiquote – Bertrand Russell,Philosopher,Europe,1950s,male
"The politician may change sides so frequently as to find himself always in the majority, but most politicians have a preference for one party to the other, and subordinate their love of power to this preference.",Bertrand Russell,leadership,Wikiquote – Bertrand Russell,Philosopher,Europe,1950s,male
"A great deal of work is sedentary, and most manual work exercises only a few specialized muscles. When crowds assemble in Trafalgar Square to cheer to the echo an announcement that the government has decided to have them killed, they would not do so if they had all walked twenty-five miles that day. This cure for bellicosity is, however, impracticable, and if the human race is to survive – a thing which is, perhaps, undesirable – other means must be found for securing an innocent outlet for the unused physical energy that produces love of excitement. This is a matter which has been too little considered, both by moralists and by social reformers. The social reformers are of the opinion that they have more serious things to consider. The moralists, on the other hand, are immensely impressed with the seriousness of all the permitted outlets of the love of excitement; the seriousness, however, in their minds, is that of Sin. Dance halls, cinemas, this age of jazz, are all, if we may believe our ears, gateways to Hell, and we should be better employed sitting at home contemplating our sins. I find myself unable to be in entire agreement with the grave men who utter these warnings. The devil has many forms, some designed to deceive the young, some designed to deceive the old and serious. If it is the devil that tempts the young to enjoy themselves, is it not, perhaps, the same personage that persuades the old to condemn their enjoyment? And is not condemnation perhaps merely a form of excitement appropriate to old age? And is it not, perhaps, a drug which – like opium – has to be taken in continually stronger doses to produce the desired effect? Is it not to be feared that, beginning with the wickedness of the cinema, we should be led step by step to condemn the opposite political party, dagoes, wops, Asiatics, and, in short, everybody except the fellow members of our club? And it is from just such condemnations, when widespread, that wars proceed. I have never heard of a war that proceeded from dance halls.",Bertrand Russell,success,Wikiquote – Bertrand Russell,Philosopher,Europe,1950s,male
"What is serious about excitement is that so many of its forms are destructive. It is destructive in those who cannot resist excess in alcohol or gambling. It is destructive when it takes the form of mob violence. And above all it is destructive when it leads to war. It is so deep a need that it will find harmful outlets of this kind unless innocent outlets are at hand. There are such innocent outlets at present in sport, and in politics so long as it is kept within constitutional bounds. But these are not sufficient, especially as the kind of politics that is most exciting is also the kind that does most harm.  Civilized life has grown altogether too tame, and, if it is to be stable, it must provide harmless outlets for the impulses which our remote ancestors satisfied in hunting.",Bertrand Russell,success,Wikiquote – Bertrand Russell,Philosopher,Europe,1950s,male
"It is normal to hate what we fear, and it happens frequently, though not always, that we fear what we hate. I think it may be taken as the rule among primitive men, that they both fear and hate whatever is unfamiliar. They have their own herd, originally a very small one. And within one herd, all are friends, unless there is some special ground of enmity. Other herds are potential or actual enemies; a single member of one of them who strays by accident will be killed. An alien herd as a whole will be avoided or fought according to circumstances. It is this primitive mechanism which still controls our instinctive reaction to foreign nations. The completely untravelled person will view all foreigners as the savage regards a member of another herd. But the man who has travelled, or who has studied international politics, will have discovered that, if his herd is to prosper, it must, to some degree, become amalgamated with other herds.",Bertrand Russell,failure,Wikiquote – Bertrand Russell,Philosopher,Europe,1950s,male
"We love those who hate our enemies, and if we had no enemies there would be very few people whom we should love.    All this, however, is only true so long as we are concerned solely with attitudes towards other human beings. You might regard the soil as your enemy because it yields reluctantly a niggardly subsistence. You might regard Mother Nature in general as your enemy, and envisage human life as a struggle to get the better of Mother Nature. If men viewed life in this way, cooperation of the whole human race would become easy. And men could easily be brought to view life in this way if schools, newspapers, and politicians devoted themselves to this end. But schools are out to teach patriotism; newspapers are out to stir up excitement; and politicians are out to get re-elected. None of the three, therefore, can do anything towards saving the human race from reciprocal suicide.",Bertrand Russell,failure,Wikiquote – Bertrand Russell,Philosopher,Europe,1950s,male
"There are two ways of coping with fear: one is to diminish the external danger, and the other is to cultivate  Stoic  endurance. The latter can be reinforced, except where immediate action is necessary, by turning our thoughts away from the cause of fear. The conquest of fear is of very great importance. Fear is in itself degrading; it easily becomes an obsession; it produces hate of that which is feared, and it leads headlong to excesses of cruelty. Nothing has so beneficent an effect on human beings as security. If an international system could be established which would remove the fear of war, the improvement in everyday mentality of everyday people would be enormous and very rapid. Fear, at present, overshadows the world. The atom bomb and the bacterial bomb, wielded by the wicked communist or the wicked capitalist as the case may be, make Washington and the Kremlin tremble, and drive men further along the road toward the abyss. If matters are to improve, the first and essential step is to find a way of diminishing fear.",Bertrand Russell,motivation,Wikiquote – Bertrand Russell,Philosopher,Europe,1950s,male
"The world at present is obsessed by the conflict of rival ideologies, and one of the apparent causes of conflict is the desire for the victory of our own ideology and the defeat of the other. I do not think that the fundamental motive here has much to do with ideologies. I think the ideologies are merely a way of grouping people, and that the passions involved are merely those which always arise between rival groups. Ideologies, in fact, are one of the methods by which herds are created, and the psychology is much the same however the herd may have been generated.",Bertrand Russell,leadership,Wikiquote – Bertrand Russell,Philosopher,Europe,1950s,male

"I do not think it can be questioned that sympathy is a genuine motive, and that some people at some times are made somewhat uncomfortable by the sufferings of some other people. It is sympathy that has produced the many humanitarian advances of the last hundred years. We are shocked when we hear stories of the ill-treatment of lunatics, and there are now quite a number of asylums in which they are not ill-treated. Prisoners in Western countries are not supposed to be tortured, and when they are, there is an outcry if the facts are discovered. We do not approve of treating orphans as they are treated in  Oliver Twist .",Bertrand Russell,success,Wikiquote – Bertrand Russell,Philosopher,Europe,1950s,male

"Killing an enemy in a modern war is a very expensive operation... It is obvious that modern war is not good business from a financial point of view. Although we won both the world wars, we should now be much richer if they had not occurred.  If men were actuated by self-interest, which they are not – except in the case of a few saints – the whole human race would cooperate.  There would be no more wars, no more armies, no more navies, no more atom bombs. There would not be armies of propagandists employed in poisoning the minds of Nation A against Nation B, and reciprocally of Nation B against Nation A. There would not be armies of officials at frontiers to prevent the entry of foreign books and foreign ideas, however excellent in themselves. There would not be customs barriers to ensure the existence of many small enterprises where one big enterprise would be more economic.  All this would happen very quickly if men desired their own happiness as ardently as they desired the misery of their neighbors.  But, you will tell me, what is the use of these utopian dreams? Moralists will see to it that we do not become wholly selfish, and until we do the millennium will be impossible.",Bertrand Russell,leadership,Wikiquote – Bertrand Russell,Philosopher,Europe,1950s,male
"I do not wish to seem to end upon a note of cynicism. I do not deny that there are better things than selfishness, and that some people achieve these things. I maintain, however, on the one hand, that there are few occasions upon which large bodies of men, such as politics is concerned with, can rise above selfishness, while, on the other hand, there are a very great many circumstances in which populations will fall below selfishness, if selfishness is interpreted as enlightened self-interest.   And among those occasions on which people fall below self-interest are most of the occasions on which they are convinced that they are acting from idealistic motives.  Much that passes as idealism is disguised hatred or disguised love of power.  When you see large masses of men swayed by what appear to be noble motives, it is as well to look below the surface and ask yourself what it is that makes these motives effective. It is partly because it is so easy to be taken in by a facade of nobility that a psychological inquiry, such as I have been attempting, is worth making. I would say, in conclusion, that if what I have said is right,  the main thing needed to make the world happy is intelligence . And this, after all, is an optimistic conclusion, because intelligence is a thing that can be fostered by known methods of education.",Bertrand Russell,success,Wikiquote – Bertrand Russell,Philosopher,Europe,1950s,male

Many warnings have been uttered by eminent men of science and by authorities in military strategy. None of them will say that the worst results are certain. What they do say is that these results are possible, and no one can be sure that they will not be realized.

"Here, then, is the problem which we present to you, stark and dreadful and inescapable:  Shall we put an end to the human race; or shall mankind renounce war?  People will not face this alternative because it is so difficult to abolish war.   The abolition of war will demand distasteful limitations of national sovereignty. But what perhaps impedes understanding of the situation more than anything else is that the term ""mankind"" feels vague and abstract.  People scarcely realize in imagination that the danger is to themselves and their children and their grandchildren, and not only to a dimly apprehended humanity. They can scarcely bring themselves to grasp that they, individually, and those whom they love are in imminent danger of perishing agonizingly.  And so they hope that perhaps war may be allowed to continue provided modern weapons are prohibited.   This hope is illusory. Whatever agreements not to use H-bombs had been reached in time of peace, they would no longer be considered binding in time of war, and both sides would set to work to manufacture H-bombs as soon as war broke out, for, if one side manufactured the bombs and the other did not, the side that manufactured them would inevitably be victorious.",Bertrand Russell,leadership,Wikiquote – Bertrand Russell,Philosopher,Europe,1950s,male

Sleep suspends many of the faculties of the vital and intellectual principle; drunkenness and disease will either temporarily or permanently derange them. Madness or idiotcy may utterly extinguish the most excellent and delicate of those powers. In old age the mind gradually withers; and as it grew and was strengthened with the body, so does it together with the body sink into decrepitude.

"I am often astonished at well-meaning, spiritual people who advocate beaming light toward world leaders, who scold activists for expressing anger toward authorities or police, who define compassion as loving the enemy — but somehow lose sight of the need to love our friends, our allies, and those who suffer at the hands of the perpetrators. I really don't feel much call to beam love and light at Bush or Cheney or the directors of the International Monetary Fund. Whether or not they suffer from lack of love is beyond me. From my perspective, they suffer from an excess of power, and I feel called to take it away from them. Because I do love the child in Iraq, the woman in the favela, the eighteen-year-old recruit to the Marines who never dreamed he was signing up to bomb civilians.

"I use “Witch” to identify with the heritage outlined above, to place myself firmly in the line of outlaw healers and purveyors of unapproved wisdom. And I use the word “magic” for much the same reason. I could say “sophisticated non-mechanistic psychology,” but that term lacks the same ring. Magic is a discipline of the mind, and it begins with understanding how consciousness is shaped and how our view of reality is constructed. Since the time of the Witch persecutions, knowledge that derives from the worldview of an animate, interconnected, dynamic universe is considered suspect—either outright evil or simply woo-woo. But whenever an area of knowledge is considered suspect, our minds are constricted. The universe is too big, too complex, too ever-changing for us to know it completely, so we choose to view it through a certain frame—one that screens out pieces of information that conflict with the categories in our minds. The narrower that frame, the more we screen out, the less we are capable of understanding or doing. (p26)",Starhawk,risk,Wikiquote – Starhawk,Author,North America,1990s,female

"This new fraud is just like the old ones: its essence lies in substituting something external for the use of our own reason and conscience and that of our predecessors: in the Church teaching this external thing was revelation, in the scientific teaching it is observation. The trick played by this science is to destroy man's faith in reason and conscience by directing attention to the grossest deviations from the use of human reason and conscience, and having clothed the deception in a scientific theory, to assure them that by acquiring knowledge of external phenomena they will get to know indubitable facts which will reveal to them the law of man's life. And the mental demoralization consists in this, that coming to believe that things which should be decided by conscience and reason are decided by observation, these people lose their consciousness of good and evil and become incapable of understanding the expression and definitions of good and evil that have been formed by the whole preceding life of humanity. All this, in their jargon, is conditional and subjective. It must all be abandoned - they say - the truth cannot be understood by one's reason, for one may err, but there is another path which is infallible and almost mechanical: one must study facts. And facts must be studied on the basis of the scientists' science, that is, on the basis of two unfounded propositions:  positivism  and  evolution  which are put forward as indubitable truths.  And the reigning science, with not less misleading solemnity than the Church, announces that the solution of all questions of life is only possible by the study of the facts of nature, and especially of organisms. A frivolous crowd of youths mastered by the novelty of this authority, which is as yet not merely not destroyed but not even touched by criticism, throws itself into the study of these facts of natural science as the sole path which, according to the assertions of the prevailing doctrine, can lead to the elucidation of the questions of life. But the further these disciples advance in this study the further and further are they removed not only from the possibility but even from the very thought of solving life's problems, and the more they become accustomed not so much to observe as to take on trust what they are told of the observations of others (to believe in cells, in protoplasm, in the fourth state of matter,1 &c.), the more and more does the form hide the contents from them; the more and more do they lose consciousness of good and evil and capacity to understand the expressions and definitions of good and evil worked out by the whole preceding life of humanity; the more and more do they adopt the specialized scientific jargon of conventional expressions which have no general human significance; the farther and farther do they wander among the debris of quite unilluminated observations; the more and more do they lose capacity not only to think independently but even to under-stand another man's fresh human thought lying outside their Talmud; and, what is most important, they pass their best years in growing unaccustomed to life, that is, to labour, and grow accustomed to consider their condition justified, while they become physically good-for-nothing parasites. And just like the theologians and the Talmudists they completely castrate their brains and become eunuchs of thought.

However foreign this teaching may have been to true Christianity, however degraded, not only in comparison with true Christianity, but even with the life-conception of the Romans such as  Julian  and others, it was for all that, to the barbarians who accepted it, a higher doctrine than their former adoration of gods, heroes, and good and bad spirits.

They did not believe in the Church doctrine, for they saw its insolvency; but neither could they follow  Francis of Assisi ,  Kelchitsky ,  and most of the sectarians in acknowledging the moral, social teaching of Christ, for that undermined their social position. And so these people remained without any religious view of life. And, having none, they could have no standard with which to estimate what was good and what was bad art, but that of personal enjoyment.",Leo Tolstoy,failure,Wikiquote – Leo Tolstoy,Author,Europe,1880s,male
"Having acknowledged the measure of the good to be pleasure, i.e., beauty, the European upper classes went back in their comprehension of art to the gross conception of the primitive Greeks which Plato had already condemned.

"The partisans of aesthetic theory denied that it was their own invention, and professed that it existed in the nature of things and even that it was recognized by the ancient Greeks. But... among the ancient Greeks, due to their low grade (compared to the Christian) moral ideal, their conception of the good was not yet sharply distinguished from their conception of the beautiful. That highest conception of goodness (not identical with beauty and for the most part, contrasting with it) discerned by the Jews even in the time of Isaiah and fully expressed by Christianity, was unknown to the Greeks. It is true that the Greek's foremost thinkers —  Socrates ,  Plato ,  Aristotle  — felt that goodness may not coincide with beauty. ...But notwithstanding all this, they could not quite dismiss the notion that beauty and goodness coincide. And consequently in the language of that period a compound word (καλο-κάγαθια, beauty-goodness) came into use to express that notion.  Evidently the Greek sages began to draw close to the perception of goodness which is expressed in Buddhism and in Christianity, but they got entangled in defining the relationship between goodness and beauty. And it was just this confusion of ideas that those Europeans of a later age ... tried to elevate into law.  ... On this misunderstanding the new science of aesthetics was built.",Leo Tolstoy,success,Wikiquote – Leo Tolstoy,Author,Europe,1880s,male
"After  Plotinus , says Schassler, fifteen centuries passed without the slightest scientific interest for the world of beauty and art. ...In reality, nothing of the kind happened. The science of aesthetics ... neither did nor could vanish, because it never existed. ... the Greeks were so little developed that goodness and beauty seemed to coincide. On that obsolete Greek view of life the science of aesthetics was invented by men of the eighteenth century, and especially shaped and mounted in  Baumgarten 's theory. The Greeks (as anyone may read in Bénard's book on Aristotle and Walter's work on Plato) never had a science of aesthetics.",Leo Tolstoy,success,Wikiquote – Leo Tolstoy,Author,Europe,1880s,male
"Aesthetic theories arose one hundred fifty years ago among the wealthy classes of the Christian European world. ...And notwithstanding its obvious insolidity, nobody else's theory so pleased the cultured crowd or was accepted so readily and with such absence of criticism. It so suited the people of the upper classes that to this day, notwithstanding its entirely fantastic character and the arbitrary nature of its assertions, it is repeated by the educated and uneducated as though it were something indubitable and self-evident.",Leo Tolstoy,success,Wikiquote – Leo Tolstoy,Author,Europe,1880s,male
"Such ... was the theory (an outgrowth of  Malthusian ) of the selection and struggle for existence as the basis of human progress. Such again, is  Marx 's theory, with regard to the gradual destruction of small private production by large capitalistic production... as an inevitable decree of fate. However unfounded such theories are, however contrary to all that is known and confessed by humanity, and however obviously immoral these may be, they are accepted with credulity, pass uncriticized, and are preached ... To this class belongs this astonishing theory of the Baungarten trinity — Goodness, Beauty and Truth — according to which it appears that the very best that can be done by the art of nations after 1900 years of Christian teaching is to choose as the ideal of their life that which was held by a small, semi-savage, slaveholding people who lived 2000 years ago, who imitated the nude human body extremely well, and erected buildings pleasing to the eye.  Educated people write long, nebulous treatises on beauty as a member of the aesthetic trinity of beauty, truth, and goodness... and they all think that by pronouncing these sacrosanct words, they speak of something quite definite and solid... on which they can base their opinions.  ... only for the purpose of justifying the false importance we attribute to an art that conveys every feeling, provided those feelings give us pleasure.",Leo Tolstoy,success,Wikiquote – Leo Tolstoy,Author,Europe,1880s,male
"The good is the everlasting, the pinnacle of our life. ... life is striving towards the good, toward God. The good is the most basic idea ... an idea not definable by reason ... yet is the postulate from which all else follows.  But the beautiful ... is just that which is pleasing. The idea of beauty is not an alignment to the good, but is its opposite, because for most part, the good aids in our victory over our predilections, while beauty is the motive of our predilections. The more we succumb to beauty, the further we are displaced from the good. ...the usual response is that there exists a moral and spiritual beauty ... we mean simply the good.  Spiritual beauty or the good, generally not only does not coincide with the typical meaning of beauty, it is its opposite.",Leo Tolstoy,success,Wikiquote – Leo Tolstoy,Author,Europe,1880s,male
"Truth is ... one approach to the attainment of the good, but in and of itself, it is neither the good nor the beautiful ...

"You have already heard that the Quakers date their epoch from  Christ , who, according to them, was the first Quaker.  Religion, say they, was corrupted almost immediately after His  death , and remained in that state of  corruption  about sixteen hundred years. But there were always a few of the faithful concealed in the world, who carefully preserved the sacred  fire , which was extinguished in all but themselves; till at length this light shone out in England in 1642.   It was at the time when Great Britain was distracted by intestine wars, which three or four sects had raised in the name of God, that one  George Fox , a native of Leicestershire, and son of a silk-weaver, took it into his head to preach the Word, and, as he pretended, with all the requisites of a true apostle; that is, without being able either to read or write. He was a young man, about twenty-five years of age, of irreproachable manners, and religiously mad. He was clad in leather from head to foot, and travelled from one village to another, exclaiming against the  war  and the clergy.",Voltaire,failure,Wikiquote – Voltaire,Philosopher,Europe,1750s,male
"This new patriarch Fox said one day to a justice of peace, before a large assembly of people. ""Friend, take care what thou dost; God will soon punish thee for persecuting his  saints ."" This magistrate, being one who besotted himself every day with bad beer and brandy, died of apoplexy two days after; just as he had signed a mittimus for imprisoning some Quakers. The sudden death of this justice was not ascribed to his intemperance; but was universally looked upon as the effect of the holy man's predictions; so that this accident made more Quakers than a thousand sermons and as many shaking fits would have done.  Cromwell , finding them increase daily, was willing to bring them over to his party, and for that purpose tried bribery; however, he found them incorruptible, which made him one day declare that this was the only religion he had ever met with that could resist the charms of  gold .    The Quakers suffered several persecutions under  Charles II ; not upon a religious account, but for refusing to pay the tithes, for ""theeing"" and ""thouing"" the magistrates, and for refusing to take the oaths enacted by the laws.    At length  Robert Barclay , a native of Scotland, presented to the king, in 1675, his ""Apology for the Quakers""; a work as well drawn up as the subject could possibly admit. The dedication to Charles II, instead of being filled with mean, flattering encomiums, abounds with bold truths and the wisest counsels. ""Thou hast tasted,"" says he to the king, at the close of his ""Epistle Dedicatory,"" ""of prosperity and adversity: thou hast been driven out of the country over which thou now reignest, and from the throne on which thou sittest: thou hast groaned beneath the yoke of oppression; therefore hast thou reason to know how hateful the oppressor is both to God and man. If, after all these warnings and advertisements, thou dost not turn unto the Lord, with all thy heart; but forget Him who remembered thee in thy distress, and give thyself up to follow lust and vanity, surely great will be thy guilt, and bitter thy condemnation. Instead of listening to the flatterers about thee, hearken only to the voice that is within thee, which never flatters. I am thy faithful friend and servant, Robert Barclay.""    The most surprising circumstance is that this letter, though written by an obscure person, was so happy in its effect as to put a stop to the persecution.",Voltaire,leadership,Wikiquote – Voltaire,Philosopher,Europe,1750s,male
"William Penn , when only fifteen years of age, chanced to meet a  Quaker  in Oxford, where he was then following his studies.  This Quaker made a proselyte of him; and our young man, being naturally sprightly and eloquent, having a very winning aspect and engaging carriage, soon gained over some of his companions and intimates, and in a short time formed a society of young Quakers, who met at his house; so that at the age of sixteen he found himself at the head of a sect. Having left college, at his return home to the vice-admiral, his father, instead of kneeling to ask his blessing, as is the custom with the English, he went up to him with his hat on, and accosted him thus: ""Friend, I am glad to see thee in good health.""  The viceadmiral thought his son  crazy ; but soon discovered he was a Quaker.  He then employed every method that prudence could suggest to engage him to behave and act like other people. The youth answered his father only with repeated exhortations to turn Quaker also. After much altercation, his father confined himself to this single request, that he would wait on the king and the duke of York with his hat under his arm, and that he would not ""thee"" and ""thou"" them.  William answered that his  conscience  would not permit him to do these things.  This exasperated his father to such a degree that he turned him out of doors. Young Penn gave God thanks that he permitted him to suffer so early in His cause, and went into the city, where he held forth, and made a great number of converts; and being young, handsome, and of a graceful figure, both court and city ladies flocked very devoutly to hear him. The patriarch Fox, hearing of his great reputation, came to London — notwithstanding the length of the journey — purposely to see and converse with him. They both agreed to go upon missions into foreign countries; and accordingly they embarked for Holland, after having left a sufficient number of laborers to take care of the London vineyard.",Voltaire,success,Wikiquote – Voltaire,Philosopher,Europe,1750s,male
